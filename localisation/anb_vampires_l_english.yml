 vampire_ruler.6.c:0 "It is not worth the cost"
 
 vampire_ruler.7.t:0 "Siring an Heir"

 vampire_ruler.10.d:0 "All vampires know the hunger, a nagging urge always in their mind, it is something no vampires cannot escape from, no matter their power, and eventually they will be consumed by that urge. Some nights the hunger is distant and a vampire can almost pretend they do not feel it. Tonight that is not the case, tonight [Root.Monarch.GetName] hungers."

 vampire_ruler.13.t:0 "The Hunt Begins"
 vampire_ruler.13.d:0 "It is well known that vampires hunt, going out on nightly incursions to find prey from whom they drain the blood, but less well known that there is more to hunting than simple nourishment; a good part of the reason vampires hunt is for the chase itself.\nWith all the nessecary preparations complete [Root.Monarch.GetName] heads out, searching for the victim who will be their prey tonight."
