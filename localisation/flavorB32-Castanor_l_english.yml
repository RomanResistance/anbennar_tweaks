While it may be possible for the new Castan to refuse to complete the Trials, that would be a decision of great shame.

 castanortrials.98.desc:0 "Every ruler of Castanor has to pass the Trials of Castan to be considered legitimate - that is without question. For most of Castanor's history, the death of a Castan would trigger a scramble for the Trialmount and the Trials, as aspirants competed for the right to become the next Castan. This was the way for centuries, until the Gerudian Ebonfrosts wrested control of the Trials for themselves, instating a policy where only the direct heirs of the Ebonfrost dynasty were allowed onto the Trialmount to take the Trials. We are at a crossroads, as the first to succeed in the Trials in many centuries. With the Trials reinstated now, what shall be our policy?"

 castanortrials.101.t:0 "The Trials of Castan"
 castanortrials.101.desc1:0 "The Trials of Castan - a tradition and mode of succession unique to Castanor - was established in 618 BA. The near-mythical Castan the Progenitor, slain during the First Great Cleansing years after defeating a gnollish invasion headed by the demonic Xhazobine, left behind an interregnum period fraught with uncertainty. The able Castan Beastbane would take up the mantle of Emperor after establishing the Trials of Castan, a series of tests designed to determine a worthy successor for Castanor. Each successive Castan had to pass the Trials left behind by their predecessors, while adding their own test to the Trials at the end.\n\nThe Trials continued on for centuries, until the Sorcerer King brought Castanor crumbling down with his ambitions on the rest of Cannor. His final defeat came at the Battle of Trialmount, where a band composed of Free-Realm heroes and their elven saviors defeated the Sorcerer King. The Trials were irreparably damaged during the battle, its magic either drained, severed, or otherwise rendered useless. Or so everyone thought, at the time.\n\nNow, centuries later, with the restoration of the North Citadel, we have incidently rediscovered that the sundering of the Trials was not as permanent as once thought! To restore Castanor, the first human empire and master of much of Cannor for centuries, our ruler must pass the Trials of Castan, as every ruler of Castanor has done in the past. Starting from the gates of the North Citadel, the traditional setting off point for the Trials, [Root.Monarch.GetName] readies [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for what would surely be a long and arduous journey."

Gnarled trees overcrowd the trial, building a mottled canopy with their moss-drenched and outstretched arms. Hours of difficult travel later, the path finally loops out to a rocky ridge, looking south toward the North Citadel and beyond. On this particularly clear day, the lands of Castanor stretched far into the distance.There was Castonath, the lower and upper sections clearly demarcated even from a distance. And even further beyond, one could almost imagine the hazy shimmer of Lake Silvermere.\n\nHere was the trial of Castan V the Great, who heralded a period of near continuous expansion and growth for Castanor. At the precipice of the ridge was a massive stone desk, with the outline of the entirety of Cannor meticulously scratched on. With a light touch to the unnaturally cold stone, the aspirant found that a thin white line appeared wherever they traced their fingers. To move past, the aspirant must draw Castanor's borders as they currently are, and then as they SHALL BE."

Once adjusted to the sudden glare of sunlight reflecting off of glossy stone, the aspirant realizes that they are looking at the Trialmount Oathstone. Chiseled directly into the rock are the oaths and pledges of previous Castans. Even the newest oaths are faded, long worn by the elements, and the oldest oaths are barely legible. The greatest despoiler was not time, however, for the damage wrought by the Battle of Trialmount is on full display here, with mighty cracks reaching to the very base of the Oathstone itself.

 # Befriend a wyvern
 castanortrials.310.t:0 "Trial of Castan XXXVI Dragonfriend"
 castanortrials.310.desc:0 "The forest starts to thin out as the craggy and imposing face of the Trialmount looms ever closer. Soft and spongy dirt, interlaced with the twists of tree roots, quickly transforms to naked rock. Soon, a deep, wide gash scarring the otherwise smooth path appears, dropping steeply down into a valley. This was the location of the Trial of Castan XXXVI Dragonfriend, though the skies and path were clear of any instructions or dragons. Confused, the aspirant starts to make their way around the deep ravine blocking their way.\n\nIn a sudden explosion of noise, a flock of birds dart out of the chasm. Quickly following is a young wyvern, its scales the color of burnished silver. Snapping its jaws futilely at the elusive flock, it soon catches the aspirant's slack-jawed face out of the corner of its eye. With humans a relatively rare sight this far up the Trialmount, the wyvern quickly loses interest in its former quarry and instead flies over to the aspirant, cocking its head in curiosity."

 castanortrials.311.desc:0 "The silver wyvern drops out of the air, still regarding the aspirant with curiosity. On the ground, it looks much small and less intimidating, reaching the height of an average man. Though a young member of the species and friendly as of yet, its wicked tail barbs and dagger-like teeth, supported by a powerful and muscular frame, betray its true potential danger. It approaches and starts sniffing the aspirant's pack."
 castanortrials.311.a:0 "No! Get away from me!"
 castanortrials.311.b:0 "Offer it your lunch"

It launches into the air - for a second, it looks as if the extra weight may cause the beast to come crashing to the ground again - but the wyvern steadies itself and soars gracefully across the chasm, letting the aspirant down gently."
 castanortrials.313.a:0 "The trials continue"
 castanorTrialsDieDescriptionDragonfriend:0 "Before the aspirant has a chance to react, the wyvern has them in its talons, deciding that the human was worth more as a tasty treat after all. The aspirant attempts to strike upward at the exposed underbelly of the beast, but to no avail, the scaled hide resisting the aspirant's futile blows. Soon, human and beast are at dizzying heights as the wyvern angles both up and toward the center of the chasm. One can imagine what happens next...\n\n"
