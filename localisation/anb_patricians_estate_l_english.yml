The most skilled are usually accepted first, but as with anything, the promise of money can often loosen up the standards somewhat.

A recent incident has occured where an academy has flat out refused to accept a patrician student, citing 'the magical ability of a cockroach' in the offended party. The patrician family, insulted, is demanding that we intervene and force the academy to accept the student, while the mages stand by their decision."

Magical workshops and artificer studios have started popping up all over Castonath, taking advantage of the resources and diverse population of the city. With this growing importance and influence of artificery comes growing pains, however. Not a year goes by without a report of some thousand year old fountain or marble spire the hapless casualty of an explosion from some artificery experiment or another. The $ESTATE_CASTONATH_PATRICIANS$ are complaining, claiming that this wanton descruction of the heritage and history of Castonath cannot continue. They are willing to put forth sums of their own money for repairs and to ensure that harsher regulations on artificery are put in place. Meanwhile, our $ESTATE_ARTIFICERS$ are natrually pushing back at any mention of 'harsher regulations', stating that their work must be allowed to continue unimpeded."

Both sit high above Lower Castonath, with a sudden sheer drop separating the two somewhat wealthier districts from the less fortunate below. The drop creates one of the most striking features amongst many in Castonath - a waterfall dropping mightily down in the middle of the city, crashing into the rocks below. Unfortunately, however, the Nath's lazily flowing waters and convenient positioning and  also makes it one of the greatest trash and sewage receptacles in the known world. Residents of the upper districts dump all sorts of refuse into the Nath, turning the water a enchangint, muddy brown. This has led to many from Lower Castonath lovingly dubbing the waterfall the 'Shitfall'.\n\nAlong with literal human refuse, many patrician owned guilds and industries take advantage of the Nath to dump toxic byproducts and other wastes for easy disposal. The residents from Lower Castonath have been complaining about higher rates of plague and general sickness from this filthy practice, and are petitioning us to make the patricians stop."
