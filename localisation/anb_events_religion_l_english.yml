 corinite.1.t:0 "The Corinite Proclamation"
 corinite.1.d:0 "Many questions have risen with the recent revelation that Castellos, the ruling deity of the Regent Court, is dead: When exactly did he die? Can the texts in Aelantir be verified? Who will lead the Regent Court now?\n\nTraditionalists attempt to keep the peace, and say that Adean, Castellos' son and rightful heir will rise up and take his father's place.\nHowever, many of those who suffered under The Greentide claim that it was the Regent Court's neglect that led to the destruction of Escann and Castellyr, and a clear sign that if Castellos was alive, and that gods were capable, that The Greentide would've been averted - and that Castellos would've protected his patron kingdom like he did in aeons past.\n\nThe rising popularity of the recently ascended God of War, Corin, the heroine of the Greentide, has called for her divine succession onto the Regent Throne through her links as the de facto successor of Agrados, Castellos' deceased brother. The Corinites in $CAPITAL$ dispute that while Adean may be a noble and chivalric god, his time under Castellos' tutelage has made him conservative, hidebound, and ultimately unable to defend the Realm against its many external threats, and that the present system of divine regency is but a poor excuse for weak and unjust rulers to retain their power and ignore the monsters and tyrants lurking beyond their borders."

 corinite.2.t:0 "The Crimson Deluge"
 corinite.2.d:0 "As the prophets of Corin spread her message across the continent, what can only be described as an apocalyptic scene has transpired in many parts of the Empire: the sky would darken, as if about to rain, only to open and release a torrent of blood onto the unsuspecting citizens. Horrified, crowds of people rushed through the streets, trying to escape from the plasma showers. Many were crushed and trampled as they attempted to escape what could only seem to be the end of the world. Whether someone acknowledges Corin or Adean as their divine mother or father, all agree that this is irrefutable evidence of a bloody and terrible war in the heavens themselves. It is only a matter of time that rivers are not fed by the blood of gods, but by the blood of men."

 corinite.3.d:0 "In many regions of Cannor a horrible rain has started. A rain of crimson blood. Almost all of Cannor east of the Dameshead is seeing regular rains of blood, causing chaos and flooding. Those affected say it must be a sign that the gods are fighting in the heavens, with Corin challenging Adean for his father's seat as ruler of the Regent Court. Reports of mass hysteria and violence is breaking out."

Their teachings have truly resonated with the [Root.GetAdjective] people and turned into a populist cause, with many professing to reading the pamphlets of the society on a daily basis, and even agreeing with their revelations and teachings of a religion that is grounded in modern expectations of truth and reason.\n\nThe Society, with the backing of the common people, have petitioned [Root.Monarch.GetName] to allow themselves to create an independent Ravelian State to facilitate the creation of Cannor's first and truly organized religion.

 ravelian.5.d:0 "The Ravelian Society was originally a group of intellectuals looking to reason and empiricism to discover the true nature of the world. With their research into the God Fragment decades ago, the society eventually discovered what they claim as a fundamental truth in the world: that there is only One God, and that the precursor elves stole magic from Them, nearly killing Them in the process. Along with their revelations they have made themselves indespensible to the masses, uplifting them and caring for them when nations across Cannor have failed, and bringing hope to a populace that an ominpotent and caring God does exist, and They are good: which is a far cry from the dynastic squabbles and flawed personalities and beliefs of the Regent Court and Corinite faith.\n\nAdherents of this new faith call for their cousins to follow this new religion, and follow the whims of God, not the whims of kings. The Ravelian Society is no more, and in its place is the Ravelian Church."

 ravelian.6.da:0 "When Aelantir was newly discovered one of our expeditions discovered an artifact called the God Fragment: a strange shard-like object that emitted high-pitched sounds that we soon deciphered to be some sort of ancient language. The lead of our expedition, the elven archaeologist and mage Torrieth, found herself to have an affinity with this object and has since spent her time researching and transcribing whatver knowledge she could gleam from it. So far we have learned little, other than the claim that this shard is the original source of magic, and that it the surviving essence of a precursor god, or according to Torrieth, the only god to have ever existed!\n\nWith the rise of the Ravelian Society and their specialization in matters of this sort, Torrieth has suggested that she take the God Fragment to Cannor in hopes that she, along with the brightest minds of the Ravelian Society, could decipher more from the God Fragment, and with our permission she would share their findings to us at a later date."

Working with our former expedition lead, and now foremost scholar on the fragment, the elven explorer Torrieth, the Ravelians now see this fragment as their best hope in unraveling the secrets of this world."

Whether it is true or not, whispers say that the fragment's high-pitched noises is actually a language that the society have begun to decipher with the help of the fragment's original discoverer, the famous elven explorer Torrieth.\nNot much else comes from this revelation, though it seems the Ravelian Society as a whole has become enamoured with this artifact, as it seems that it is not their best hope to unraveling the secrets of this world."
 ravelian.8.a:0 "Who knows what will come from this?"
 ravelian.11.t:0 "The [Root.ravelian_councils] Ravelian Debate: [Root.ravelian_councils_desc]"

 ravelian.11.da:0 "The Regent Court believes that when you die, you get judged by Nerat, and depending on if you've lived according to your patron deity's ideals determines whether you go to Hell, serve penance in Nerat's armies against Hell, or live your life in blissful paradise in your respective deity's divine plane. While the nature of the Infernal Planes and Nerat's Fugue Plane has been confirmed by countless accounts of demons bound in summoning circles and Red Reapers sighted hunting down undead, it is the nature of the Celestial Planes that has eluded most of the modern world... until now.\n\nGreat research and forays into planar binding have allowed the Ravelian Church to contact and communicate with a great number of celestial beings and have discerned that they too are just as lost as we are. Their beliefs and lore are just as diverse and shrouded in mystery as ours, but one thing persists throughout: that the equivalent of their founder or creator is dead, and that their origin myths all contain an ancestral homeland that their race originated from.\n\nThis revelation, combined with new transcripts from the God Fragment and cross-referencing commonalities of myth in our world's cultures and religions have led to the conclusions that: Heaven exists, but its gates are closed and its location forgotten with the near-death of the One God. The dead do get judged in the Fugue Plane, but by (red-cloaked) angels of death, not Nerat, and that both the celestial and infernal gain power due to belief in their creators. Since the belief in a One God has faltered, so has the powers of the celestials, explaining their absence in the Prime Material Plane.\nIt is with this that the Ravelian Church now believes more than ever that revealing the truth of a One God to the world is paramount, and that by restoring faith in God will the gates of Heaven open and salvation can be achieved by all - both mortal and celestial.\n\nThe Ravelian Debate in question now lies: on how do we achieve salvation and empower God in the first place?\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nConversion is but the first step. The Regent Court mythos of emulating your patron's ideals is the truth. God is good and wants us to be good. We must perform Good Works for the church, ourselves and each other if we are truly empower God.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nIt is true belief and understanding alone that empowers God. Not only knowing, but truly understanding the Truth is what faith is made of, and as such we can only achieve true salvation through ruminating on the truths that have been revealed before us!"

 ravelian.11.db:0 "With the last Ravelian Debate securing the need to convert as many people to the faith to empower God and ensure salvation for all, the Second Ravelian Debate deals with internal matters of the church and how it should best achieve that:\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nHeresy and willful ignorance is rife across the world, and if they will not embrace the truth through debate and an open mind, then they must be saved through force. The Ravelian Inquistion will allow our faith to spread like wildfire and save the ignorant from themselves. Inquisitors will also ensure that those that do practice magic do so under the Church's approval, for magic is a gift from God and must not be squandered in dark arts and unholy works, lest they wish to join the heretics on the pyre.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nIf heathens and heretics refuse to hear our truth, then it the failure of the Church, not the fault of the unconvinced. False conversions will not help unlock Heaven. We must keep public and cordial discourse with them at all times, and open our minds to learn from their versions of the truth - and perhaps one day, we will reach new revelations together.!"

 ravelian.11.dc:0 "The idea the there is only One God is a strange one. Seldom do the faiths of the world deny the existence of all others gods, and even the Bulwari say that 'all gods are dead except ours', not 'all gods do not exist except ours'. Indeed, the all-encompassing and all-powerful nature of God has meant that we have found many commonalities in other gods to fold them into our idea of worshipping the One God. By looking at deity figures across Halann in a holistic way, the scholars of the church have determined that lesser "gods", like Surael, are in fact but facets, or aspects, of the One God. For God is Everything, and as such can wear many faces.\n\nAdditionally, research into the inner workings of divine figures throughout history like the avatar Corin has revealed that she, along with other prominent avatars, was imbued with otherwordly powers, and that if magic is indeed divine in origin, then she is but a powerful mage gifted with the ability to naturally wield magic, rather than control and tame it as wizards do. We have declared her and other extraordinary individuals that have no doubt been gifted divine providence (like Aldresia in her stopping of the White Pestilience) as the first Saints of the Ravelian Church.\n\nWith these revelations, the question has fallen on how to approach this topic in terms of converting the rest of the world.\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nMany cultures have heroic figures and scores of deities. We must use Sainthood as an open palm to welcome them to the fold with ease, even if that means relaxing our restrictions on canonizing new saints. Their heroes are our saints, for God truly works in mysterious ways, and if God did not give these figures of legend divine providence then surely they would not be granted success?\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nOpening our faith to accept anyone and everyone as saints, and god forbid, aspects, is a mockery of the Ravelian Society's original ambitions to unravel the truth of this world. We must scrutinize every saint, every aspect, every religion and every culture with a rational eye. We must not fear upsetting and destroying chances of converting the people if it means eroding the very core of what we believe!"

 ravelian.11.dd:0 "The Church has always held the belief that magic is divine. It is at the very foundation of Original Sin for the faith, as the precursor elves had been impatient and stole magic from God, instead of waiting for God to bestow magic upon them when the time was right as They did with dragons.\n\nFor a very long time, most scholars have disagreed with this idea that all magic is divine, but with recent advancements in researching the nature of magic and the God Fragment, the church has put forward a 'True Source of Magic Hypothesis'. The hypothesis is based upon the popular secular theory of 'Universal Magic' which claims that the old categorization of magic into areas like divine, arcane, bardic, and runic, is arbitrary, and was simply a way to explain 'how' magic was manipulated, rather than its true nature. The Ravelian hypothesis builds on this and combines it with existing scripture to provide enough evidence to make even the most hardcore secularist consider their beliefs: there is only one type of magic, but that type is divine, and that God is the true source of magic!\n\nWith these revelations, the church's attention has turned to the usage of artificery. For a long time, the church has believed that artificery was the great equalizer in righting the wrongs of the precursor elves, and allowed all, not just the few, to reap the benefits of magic. The two major factions of the church have proposed conflicting stances on the future of artificery in the Ravelian faith.\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nThe great advancements in artificery are not only a vessel to right the precursor elves' sins, but are in fact God's Decree that *now* is the time to spread Their divinity to all Their creations. While not all can harness or be gifted with magic, through artificery we could allow the divine gift of magic to be accessible to everyone and anyone, regardless of if they currently follow our beliefs. This should be done no matter the cost, and as soon as possible, to right the wrongs of the past.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nMagic should be shared, yes, but it is because of magic's divine yet mysterious nature that it should be shared with care and vigilance. Artificery itself is not only holy work but work that requires great time, patience and deliberation. The good works artificery can give to the world must be balanced with heavily scrutinized and sanctified methodology, and if that means witholding great advancements from everyday life to ensure it is done correctly, keeping God's gifts to the faithful only, or even witholding darker and forbidden methods and inventions from the masses for their own safety, then so be it."

 ravelian.302.t:0 "Traitorous Rectors"
 ravelian.302.d:0 "Rectors within our country have started sharing knowledge with scholars from our rival [rival_country.GetName]. This is dangerous, and could see event_target:rival_country taking technological advances from us."
 ravelian.302.a:0 "For the good of knowledge and growth, allow it to continue."
 ravelian.302.b:0 "Stop it before they learn anything."
 ravelian.303.t:0 "Rival Scholars"
 ravelian.303.d:0 "Ravelian scholars from one of our rival countries have helped our technological advancement. How altruistic of them."
 ravelian.303.a:0 "Thanks."

 ravelian.400.t:0 "Researchers Request Escort"
 ravelian.400.d:0 "Ravelian Researchers have petitioned you for military help in a delicate matter of theirs: researching the nature of celestials. They do not trust adventurers to keep their word or to follow their orders directly, and as such have turned to us for support."
 ravelian.400.a:0 "Provide an escort."
 ravelian.400.b:0 "They can do it themselves."
 ravelian.401.t:0 "Ravelians Ruin Burial Grounds"
 ravelian.401.d:0 "A group of Ravelian scholars have been captured and put on the stockade in [cemetary_province.GetName] for ransacking a nearby burial ground. Your own officials confirm these accusations, and the entire place seems to have been upturned and various corpses desecrated!"
 ravelian.401.a:0 "They must have had their reasons?"
 ravelian.401.b:0 "Free the scholars."
 ravelian.402.t:0 "Ravelian Expedition Requests Funds"
 ravelian.402.d:0 "A group of Ravelian scholars, led by a prominent Rector, in addition to a handful of adventurers are petitioning us to help fund their endeavours abroad.\nThey claim to seek knowledge regarding the planes of existence, and other sorts of malarkey that has no relevance to a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ravelian.402.a:0 "Give them the funds."
 ravelian.402.b:0 "Send the Rector back to the Church."
 ravelian.402.c:0 "Send a few of our explorers with them!"
 ravelian.403.t:0 "Flagellants on the Streets"
 ravelian.403.d:0 "Hell is on the lips of the faithful in [Root.GetName].\nScores of Ravelians march down the streets, whipping themselves in repentance for their alleged sins. Leading them are priests, Rectors, claiming that only through public displays of the faith can one be truly freed of their sins, and only then can they ascend to Heaven."
 ravelian.403.a:0 "Let them believe what they believe."
 ravelian.403.b:0 "Break up these doomsayers!"
 ravelian.404.t:0 "Afterlife Debate Causes Panic"
 ravelian.404.d:0 "A much anticipated discussion on the nature of the afterlife, and what it truly means to go to Heaven or go to Hell has sparked fear across the nation.\nMany prominent Ravelians engaging in the debate have made their own contradictory and inflammatory comments, and the lack of agreement and clarity from even the most astute scholars of [Root.Country.GetName] has caused worry for the common man."
 ravelian.404.a:0 "The truth must always prevail!"
 ravelian.404.b:0 "Try to appease the masses."

 ravelian.500.t:0 "Forced Conversions"
 ravelian.500.d:0 "We have received reports that the province of [Root.GetName] has been forcibly converted to the Ravelian faith by an angry mob and an even angrier rector. Only a small number of people have died, and many have been dragged out onto the streets to profess the faith or be beaten by the mob."
 ravelian.500.a:0 "Finally they see the truth."
 ravelian.500.b:0 "Question these practices."
 ravelian.501.t:0 "$ESTATE_BURGHERS$ Paid to Convert"
 ravelian.501.d:0 "We have received word that several prominent members of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ estate have been bragging that the Ravelian Church has sent them a large amount of crowns to convert to the faith. While what is done is done, this blatant corruption has given one of our shrewdest advisors an idea: what if we confiscate their ill-gotten gains? After all, we should be converting out of faith and reason, not coin."
 ravelian.501.a:0 "Religion works in mysterious ways..."
 ravelian.501.b:0 "Confiscate their ill-gotten gains!"
 ravelian.502.t:0 "University Conversion Debates"
 ravelian.502.d:0 "It has come to our attention of a recent trend amongst our colleges and universities, where prominent members of RavelSoc (the local Ravelian University Society) have started inviting other students to debate the nature of religion and the existence of a One True God. Several members of the faculty have become worried, especially due to the fact that many students have debated and converted shortly thereafter."
 ravelian.502.a:0 "Good for them."
 ravelian.502.b:0 "Send a Rector to help the RavelSoc."
 ravelian.503.t:0 "Courtier Converts Prominent Mage!"
 ravelian.503.d:0 "Mages have always been a fickle lot, especially when it comes to religion, as they are often wont to believe that their arcane powers is a fine substitute for faith.\nOne such critic has been converted and has finally embraced the Truth, thanks to the persitent influence of our Ravelian courtiers. The mage in question has come to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for advice on how to best impact the Ravelian faith."
 ravelian.503.a:0 "Work with the church to influence the $ESTATE_MAGES$."
 ravelian.503.b:0 "Their keen mind will be a boon in finding new revelations."
 ravelian.504.t:0 "Ravelian Pogrom"
 ravelian.504.d:0 "The faithful have gathered in angry crowds and stormed prominent religious minority districts in [Root.GetName], killing many of its inhabitants and vandalizing many of its properties.\nThe crowd chants that due to a theory that 'Heaven will only be unlocked once all are converted to the faith', that killing the unfaithful means that more people are true believers overall - so surely that means that the faith is closer to achieving salvation?"
 ravelian.504.a:0 "Ignorant fools!"
 ravelian.504.b:0 "Makes sense to me."

 ravelian.600.t:0 "Should Avatar-Saints and God-Saints be Equal?"
 ravelian.600.d:0 "The Ravelian faith believes that most, if not all religions are simply aspects of a one true faith and a One True God. Sainthood was a way to recognize holy figures in the mythos of possible-converts, and to some, a clever way to extend an open hand of friendship to those that might be put off by the idea of a monotheistic religion that denies the existence of other faiths.\nA recent debate, however, has sparked between our own believers: is it right that avatars, divine reincarnation of the Regent Court gods, are held at the same rank and respect as what were fully-realised deities? An example of this was St. Auci Dameris, queen of Dameria and St. Minara: Auci has been well-regarded as an avatar of The Dame (an accepted aspect of God) and canonized for her endeavours in bringing the elves to Cannor. Minara, however, has always been regarded as a lesser deity of the Regent Court.\n\nThe church's official stance is that all saints are the same, but the rectors have been arguing and debating this for months now!"
 ravelian.600.a:0 "We support the official stance."
 ravelian.600.b:0 "Perhaps there is more to this?"
 ravelian.601.t:0 ""Saint" in our Dynasty"
 ravelian.601.d:0 "A highly suspect but incredibly influental rector has mentioned to us the other day that they might have found "proof" that one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ancestors may have done enough holy works to be canonized as a saint.\n\n"Of course, this research is incredibly expensive. Extra... funding may be needed," they suggest."
 ravelian.601.a:0 "Oh, of course."
 ravelian.601.b:0 "We will wait for further revelations."
 ravelian.602.t:0 "Government Critic Canonized"
 ravelian.602.d:0 "A recently deceased but prominent critic of the [Root.GetAdjective] government has apparently been canonized by the High Rector!\n\nIn life they were an incredibly vocal voice against our endeavours, and now they are a saint, it might impact us badly if we let their criticisms fester."
 ravelian.602.a:0 "Saint words are holy words."
 ravelian.602.b:0 "Cover it up."
 ravelian.603.t:0 "Clash Between the Faithful"
 ravelian.603.d:0 "The topic of debate in the mouths of the Ravelian faithful have been the idea of Aspects and Saints, and which one is more important. Are all other gods Aspects? Or just some of them? Surely evil gods like Bulwar's Malevolent Dark cannot be an aspect of the One True God, who is all-good? Surely Agrados, who raped Halanna, cannot be a part of God?\n\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has been in a deadlock debating on this over and over and over again, and one of our shrewdest courtiers suggest that letting them distract themselves can allow us to increase our control over the estates."
 ravelian.603.a:0 "Try to mediate."
 ravelian.603.b:0 "Let them fight."
 ravelian.604.t:0 "Your God is Fake, Good Sir!"
 ravelian.604.d:0 "Glasses shattered, expletives thrown. On numerous occasions.\n\nOur diplomatic corps have become known as firebrands and agitators, espousing to foreign dignitaries from lands afar that their beliefs are false and that their gods are nonexistent.\nWhile this may be true on some cases, diplomacy requires tact and grace, not blunt accusations."
 ravelian.604.a:0 "But, your gods ARE fake!"
 ravelian.604.b:0 "Let the priests determine what is real or not."

 ravelian.700.t:0 "Artificer Giving Away Inventions?!"
 ravelian.700.d:0 "A rogue artificer has been seen standing outside his workshop giving away schematics, prototypes and incredibly expensive inventions to any passer-by. He claims that he has finally see the Truth and embraced God, and that God demands that magic be available for all - and for those who cannot practise magic: artificery is the next best thing!\n\nThe $ESTATE_ARTIFICERS$ are not impressed. This rogue artificer was one of their best, and he's giving away guild secrets!"
 ravelian.700.a:0 "Artificery belongs to all."
 ravelian.700.b:0 "Help the artificers shut him down."
 ravelian.701.t:0 "Ravelian Pogrom of Elves"
 ravelian.701.d:0 "The holy texts state that the precursor elves committed the Original Sin by binding and defeating God to steal their magic. This revelations has been on the mouths of many a fire and brimstone preacher for the past few months and now this rhetoric has taken an anti-elven turn. A mob of devout Ravelians have stormed elven neighbourhoods in [Root.GetName], slaughtering the innocent in the name of God.\n\nWhile the precursor elves did do this, the elven people living in [Root.GetName] were not responsible - hells, most elves dont even practice magic. Surely the sins of the father are not sins of the son?"
 ravelian.701.a:0 "The mob has a point..."
 ravelian.701.b:0 "Stop them!"
 ravelian.702.t:0 "Artificery Work Denounced by Church"
 ravelian.702.d:0 "The field of artifice is always pushing new boundaries, and it seems one of those boundaries has again been crossed.\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ in our realm have denounced a recent invention by the $ESTATE_ARTIFICERS$ and are calling any who purchase or even speak of the device as hedonists and sinners."
 ravelian.702.a:0 "Support the Artificers."
 ravelian.702.b:0 "Support the Denouncement."
 ravelian.703.t:0 "Magical Cult Leader: Heretic?"
 ravelian.703.d:0 "All magic is said to have come from God one way or another, and as such magic is divine. For some this has been used to promote artificery for the benefit for the masses, but for others, especially those gifted with magic, it has allowed an aura of allure and gravitas that equals the Age of Witch Kings.\nOne such individual has amassed a large following in [Root.GetName], calling themselves a 'Living Saint' and using their powers to, admittedly, do good works.\nA Rectorate Inquisitor has arrived in our domain, and advises that we act against this heretic, for this is a dangerous precedence to allow mages parade themselves as if they were gods."
 ravelian.703.a:0 "Send them something they won't expect..."
 ravelian.703.b:0 "If magic is divine, why not?"
