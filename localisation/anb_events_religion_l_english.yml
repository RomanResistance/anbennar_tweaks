 corinite.1.t:0 "The Corinite Proclamation"
 corinite.1.d:0 "Many questions have risen with the recent revelation that Castellos, the ruling deity of the Regent Court, is dead: When exactly did he die? Can the texts in Aelantir be verified? Who will lead the Regent Court now?\n\nTraditionalists attempt to keep the peace, and say that Adean, Castellos' son and rightful heir will rise up and take his father's place.\nHowever, many of those who suffered under The Greentide claim that it was the Regent Court's neglect that led to the destruction of Escann and Castellyr, and a clear sign that if Castellos was alive, and that gods were capable, that The Greentide would've been averted - and that Castellos would've protected his patron kingdom like he did in aeons past.\n\nThe rising popularity of the recently ascended God of War, Corin, the heroine of the Greentide, has called for her divine succession onto the Regent Throne through her links as the de facto successor of Agrados, Castellos' deceased brother. The Corinites in $CAPITAL$ dispute that while Adean may be a noble and chivalric god, his time under Castellos' tutelage has made him conservative, hidebound, and ultimately unable to defend the Realm against its many external threats, and that the present system of divine regency is but a poor excuse for weak and unjust rulers to retain their power and ignore the monsters and tyrants lurking beyond their borders."

 corinite.2.t:0 "The Crimson Deluge"
 corinite.2.d:0 "As the prophets of Corin spreads her message across the continent, what can only be described as an apocalyptic scene has transpired in many parts of the Empire: the sky would darken, as if about to rain, only to open and release a torrent of blood onto the unsuspecting citizens. Horrified, crowds of people rushed through the streets, trying to escape from the plasma showers. Many were crushed and stamped on as they attempted to escape what could only seem to be the end of the world. Whether someone acknowledges Corin or Adean as their divine mother or father, all agree that this irrefutable evidence of a bloody and terrible war in the heavens themselves. It is only a matter of time that rivers are not fed by the blood of gods, but the blood of men."

Almost all of Cannor east of the Dameshead is seeing regular rains of blood, causing chaos and flooding. Those affected say it must be a sign that the gods are fighting in the heavens, with Corin challenging Adean for his father's seat as ruler of the Regent Court. Reports of mass hysteria and violence is breaking out."

Their teachings have truly resonated with the [Root.GetAdjective] people and turned into a populist cause, with many professing to reading the pamphlets of the society on a daily basis, and even agreeing with their revelations and teachings of a religion that is grounded in modern expectations of truth and reason.\n\nThe Society, with the backing of the common people, have petitioned [Root.Monarch.GetName] to allow themselves to create an independent Ravelian State to facilitate the creation of Cannor's first and truly organized religion.

 ravelian.5.d:0 "The Ravelian Society was originally a group of intellectuals looking to reason and empiricism to discover the true nature of the world. With their research into the God Fragment decades ago, the society eventually discovered what they claim as a fundamental truth in the world: that there is only One God, and that the precursor elves stole magic from Them, nearly killing Them in the process. Along with their revelations they have made themselves indespensible to the masses, uplifting them and caring for them when nations across Cannor have failed, and bringing hope to a populace that an ominpotent and caring God does exist, and They are good: which is a far cry from the dynastic squabbles and flawed personalities and beliefs of the Regent Court and Corinite faith.\n\nAdherents of this new faith call for their cousins to follow this new religion, and follow the whims of God, not the whims of kings. The Ravelian Society is no more, and in its place is the Ravelian Church."

 ravelian.6.t:0 "Ravelian Society-God Fragment Research?"
 ravelian.6.da:0 "When Aelantir was newly discovered one of our expeditions discovered an artifact called the God Fragment: a strange shard-like object that emitted high-pitched sounds that we soon deciphered to be some sort of ancient language. The lead of our expedition, the elven archaeologist and mage Torrieth, found herself to have an affinity with this object and has since spent her time researching and transcribing whatver knowledge she could gleam from it. So far we have learned little, other than the claim that this shard is the original source of magic, and that it the surviving essence of a precursor god, or according to Torrieth, the only god to have ever existed!\n\nWith the rise of the Ravelian Society and their specialization in matters of this sort, Torrieth has suggested that she take the God Fragment to Cannor in hopes that she, along with the brightest minds of the Ravelian Society, could decipher more from the God Fragment, and with our permission she would share their findings to us at a later date."

Working with our former expedition lead, and now foremost scholar on the fragment, the elven explorer Torrieth, the Ravelians now see this fragment as their best hope in unraveling the secrets of this world."

Whether it is true or not, whispers say that the fragment's high-pitched noises is actually a language that the society have begun to decipher with the help of the fragment's original discoverer, the famous elven explorer Torrieth.\nNot much else comes from this revelation, though it seems the Ravelian Society as a whole has become enamoured with this artifact, as it seems that it is not their best hope to unraveling the secrets of this world."
 ravelian.8.a:0 "Who knows what will come from this?"
 ravelian.11.t:0 "The [Root.ravelian_councils] Ravelian Debate: [Root.ravelian_councils_desc]"
 ravelian.11.da:0 "The Regent Court believes that when you die, you get judged by Nerat, and depending on if you've lived to your patron deity's ideals determines whether you go to Hell, serve penance in Nerat's armies against Hell, or live your life in blissful paradise in your respective deity's divine plane. While the nature of the Infernal Planes and Nerat's Fugue Plane has been confirmed by countless accounts of demons bound in summoning circles and Red Reapers sighted hunting down undead, it is the nature of the Celestial Planes that has eluded most of the modern world... until now.\n\nGreat research and forays into planar binding have allowed the Ravelian Church to contact and communicate with a great number of celestial beings and have discerned that they too are just as lost as we are. Their beliefs and lore is just as diverse and shrouded in mystery as ours, but one thing persists throughout: that the equivalent of their founder or creator is dead, and that their origin myths all contain an ancestral homeland that their race originated from.\n\nThis revelation, combined with new transcripts from the God Fragment and cross-referencing commonalities myth in our world's cultures and religions have led to the conclusions that: Heaven exists, but its gates are closed and its location forgotten with the near-death of the One God. The dead do get judged in the Fugue Plane, but by (red-cloaked) angels of death, not Nerat, and that both the celestial and infernal gain power due to belief in their creators. Since the belief in a One God has faltered, so has the powers of the celestials, explaining their absence in the Prime Material Plane.\nIt is with this that the Ravelian Church now believes more than ever that revealing the truth of a One God to the world is paramount, and that by restoring faith in God will the gates of Heaven open and salvation can be achieved by all - both mortal and celestial.\n\nThe Ravelian Debate in question now lies: on how do we achieve salvation and empower God in the first place?\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nConversion is but the first step. The Regent Court mythos of emulating your patron's ideals is the truth. God is good and wants us to be good. We must perform Good Works for the church, ourselves and each other if we are truly empower God.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nIt is true belief and understanding alone that empowers God. Not only knowing, but truly understanding the Truth is what faith is made of, and as such we can only achieve true salvation through ruminating on the truths that have been revealed before us!"
 ravelian.11.db:0 "With the last Ravelian Debate securing the need to convert as many people to the faith to empower God and ensure salvation for all, the Second Ravelian Debate deals with internal matters of the church and how it should best achieve that:\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nHeresy and willful ignorance is rife across the world, and if they will not embrace the truth through debate and an open mind, then they must be saved through force. The Ravelian Inquistion will allow our faith to spread like wildfire and save the ignorant from themselves. Inquisitors will also ensure that those that do practice magic do so under the Church's approval, for magic is a gift from God and must not be squandered in dark arts and unholy works, lest they wish join the heretics on the pyre.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nIf heathens and heretics refuse to hear our truth then it the failure of the Church, not the fault of the unconvinced. False conversions will not help unlock Heaven. We must keep public and cordial discourse with them at all times, and open our minds to learn from their version of the truth - and perhaps one day, we will reach new revelations together.!"
 ravelian.11.dc:0 "The idea the there is only One God is a strange one. Seldom do the faiths of the world deny the existence of all others gods, and even the Bulwari say that 'all gods are dead except ours', not 'all gods do not exist except ours'. Indeed, due to the all-encompassing and all-powerful nature of God has meant that we have found many commonalities in other gods to fold them into our idea of worshipping the One God. By looking at deity figures across Halann in a holistic way, the scholars of the church have determined that lesser "gods", like Surael, are in fact but facets, or aspects, of the One God. For God is Everything, and as such can wear many faces.\n\nAdditionally, research into the inner workings of divine figures throughout history like the avatar Corin have revealed that she, along with other prominent avatars, were imbued with otherwordly powers, and that if magic is indeed divine in origin, then she is but a powerful mage gifted with the ability to naturally wield magic, rather than control and tame it as wizards do. We have declared her and other extraordinary individuals that have no doubt been gifted divine providence (like Aldresia in her stopping of the White Pestilience) as the first Saints of the Ravelian Church.\n\nWith these revelations, the question has fallen on how to approach this topic in terms of converting the rest of the world.\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nMany cultures have heroic figures and scores of deities. We must use Sainthood as an open palm to welcome them to the fold with ease, even if that means relaxing our restrictions on canonizing new saints. Their heroes are our saints, for God truly works in mysterious ways, and if God did not give these figures of legend divine providence then surely they would not be granted success?\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nOpening our faith to accept anyone and everyone as saints, and god forbid, aspects, is a mockery of the Ravelian Society's original ambitions to unravel the truth of this world. We must scrutinize every saint, every aspect, every religion and every culture with a rational eye. We must not fear upsetting and destroying chances of converting the people if it means eroding the very core of what we believe!"
 ravelian.11.dd:0 "The Church has always held the belief that magic is divine. It is at the very foundation of Original Sin for the faith, as the precursor elves had been impatient and stole magic from God, instead of waiting for God to bestow magic upon them when the time was right as They did with dragons.\n\nFor a very long time, most scholars have disagreed with this idea that all magic is divine but with recent advancements in researching the nature of magic and the God Fragment, the church has put a 'True Source of Magic Hypothesis'. The hypothesis is based upon the popular secular theory of 'Universal Magic' which claims that the old categorization of magic into areas like divine, arcane, bardic, and runic, is arbitrary, and was simply a way to explain 'how' magic was manipulated, rather than its true nature. The Ravelian hypothesis builds on this and combines it with existing scripture to provide enough evidence to make even the most hardcore secularist consider their beliefs: there is only one type of magic, but that type is divine, and that God is the true source of magic!\n\nWith these revelations, the church's attention has turned to the usage of artificery. For a long time, the church has believed that artificery was the great equalizer in writing the wrongs of the precursor elves, and allowed all, not just the few, to reap the benefits of magic. The two major factions of the church have proposed conflicting stances on the future of artificery  in the Ravelian faith.\n\n§RZealot Doctrine§!\nThe great advancements in artificery is not only a vessel to right the precursor elves' sins, but in fact God's Decree that *now* is the time to spread Their divinity to all Their creations. While not all can harness or be gifted with magic, through artificery we could allow the divine gift of magic to be accessible to everyone and anyone, regardless if they currently follow our beliefs. This should be done no matter the cost, and as soon as possible, to write the wrongs of the past.\n\n§BErudite Doctrine§!\nMagic should be shared, yes, but it is because of magic's divine yet mysterious nature that it should be shared with care and vigilance. Artificery itself is not only holy work but work that requires great time, patience and deliberation. The good works artificery can give to the world must be balanced with heavily scrutinized and sanctified methodology, and if that means witholding great advancements from everyday life to ensure it is done correctly, keeping God's gifts to the faithful only, or even witholding darker and forbidden methods and inventions from the masses for their own safety, then so be it."
