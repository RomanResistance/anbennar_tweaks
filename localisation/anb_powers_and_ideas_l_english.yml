And in turn, the vast quantities of the metal that the dwarves retrieved from the depths of the mountains threatened the stability of the nation's treasury. To create some relative stability, the council of clans had a massive vault constructed, where all the gold that was mined would be stored. Then they created a new institution, that of the Vault Magistrates. It was their job to carefully measure the quantities of gold in the vault and to always track the stores.

It was opened rarely during the time when the mountains were overrun by goblins and orcs, but as the Dwarovar was reclaimed by dwarves they were open more often than not. The gate is decorated with depictions of dwarven craftsmanship and great feats of engineering.\n\nThe Miner's Gate faces the underneath.

Due to being founded by exiles and criminals, Krakdhûmvror had very few strong clans at the time of its founding. As such, unlike the rigid hierarchy of the other holds, Krakdhûmvror has held talent in a higher regard than bloodline or clan. As a result talent is far more likely to rise to the top in the northern hold and nepotism is considered all but sacrilegious in the frozen halls of power.\n\nThus Krakdhûmvror has enjoyed an innovative and flexible administration for much of its existence. Many a time did a disgraced scion of a noble imperial house flee to Krakdhûmvror demanding status and position based on little more than their parentage and all were told the same thing: 'Zaru ubr Bloth', Skill over Blood."

There is little in the way of pomp and circumstance in the halls of the frozen hold. This is not without purpose; every building in Krakdhûmvror is dedicated to the singular purpose of defence and survival. Even the smallest hovel is all but a fortress unto itself.

In ages past its first inhabitants were banished from the Empire and deliberately isolated from their brethren; the men and women of the hold and the fortress that preceded it had very little interest in the affairs of the outside world. But the world has changed and the hold must change with it.

It was common practice to banish criminals there to man the battlements and give their lives in defence of the Empire.

In the eyes of the rulers of Krakdhûmvror this left far too much to chance, especially when it came to the defence of the hold.\n\nAs such in 1523 The Rite of Cold Iron, a rigorous examination that every dwarf seeking to join the military must take prior to being accepted, was created. This rite would later evolve into what was one of the first examples of a dedicated officer academy in all of Cannor, accepting any who had the aptitude to pass the rite."

Because of our reputation for fair deals, these so-called 'early payments' became commonplace, and were often overseen by Belgar, who got a small cut.

When he passed from this world, his students took his lessons to heart, and eventually our military culture came to embody Thorin's ideals.

This lesson taught that laxity rests as the worst of sins, for only through preparedness were we able to throw back the orcish tide and save our precious homeland.

In times past we would answer the calls of the so often capricious feys and ride to war for some elusive ends. Many of the peoples who borders the Deepwoods still have folk stories warning children that if they misbehave then the fey-folk will steal them away in their sleep.

These fey hoped that Wood Elves, which settled these woods near 1000 AA could be used for their goals, but the Wood Elves turned out to be resistant to their magic and weren't interested in war with humans.

His clan sacked Bladekeep and the dreadful howls they performed during the pillage had given them their name. The Blackmoon Clan on the other side was famous for their battle shamans, who unleashed their magical power on the armies of humans and dwarves. The Silentblade Clan was considered somewhat dishonorable by other orcs, but they excelled in guerrilla combat, using ambushes to defeat their foes.

Their skin is now as hard as bark and provides great defence from regular weapons and firearms, while the inherent orcish trength was pushed even further, making them as strong as ogres. All these gifts were given to help orcs crush the human and orc realms in Cannor and plant a new Deepwoods in their place. It is our desire that the World Tree may be revived and, hopefully, emerald orcs will be accepted as full-fledged fey and be allowed to enter the Feyrealm, the Plane of Life and Magic, where fey hold their eternal feasts."

After that an enraged Bron challenged his father to duel for the title of high shaman and murdered him without hesitation. He assembled all uncorrupted shamans and collectively they used their magecraft to create the Black Hearth which turned the tides of war in their favor.

Finally the unit was wiped out in a heroic last stand as they stood their ground against an army twenty times their number. Supposedly they broke their enemies despite having been completely destroyed and Harimar considered it a tragic victory, but a victory nonetheless.

They approached the enemy lines in more spread out formations before converging on the enemy in a rapid charge."

As such, they were constantly under threat of assault from outside forces, with said threat only exasperated by their great wealth. As such, the cities always lay behind massive walls in order to keep them secure.\n\nBy the 1600s, however, this situation became unfeasible, as the cities’ inhabitants pressed against the walls, and the cities ran out of room. This led to several vast construction projects throughout the region, as old walls were demolished, and new ones were constructed several dozen attilambi away. This would begin a pattern lasting throughout the coming centuries, as walls were repeatedly demolished and rebuilt ever further away to make room for the rapidly growing populations of the porcelain cities."

However, with the rise in global trade routes brought on during the Age of Artificers, Dhujati trade routes would expand well beyond Haless and into the rest of the world; from Cannor to Sarhal to distant Aelentir, one would have to search extremely hard for a single port without at least a few Dhujati merchants. And for each one of those merchants, every deal they struck, every good they sold, every coin that fell into their pockets, all of that wealth would return with them back up the Kharunyana, and only make the porcelain cities wealthier yet."

 F17_no_representation_no_tax_desc:0 "The Crathánori secession from Re'uyel was primarily motivated by lack of representation in the newly formed nobles' republic that had overthrown the previous regime. The province of Crathánor had few nobles yet many merchants, and thus had few representatives in the government. This meant that the Crathánori had no power to stop the Re'uyeli nobles from placing heavy tax burdens on them.\n\nAs a result, the merchants began agitating for independence. In 1421 they delivered an ultimatum to the nobility: Give us fair representation, or we will stop paying taxes. This was coldly rejected, and thus Crathánor seceded, adopting a condensed version of the ultimatum as its official motto. This would become the founding principle of the newborn republic."

Only when the dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr came to their aid could the deadlock be broken. But just as the tide had turned, the goblin invasions began in 1423.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the untrained militia fought many desperate battles, winning some and losing many.

To this day, they worship the Regent Court pantheon like their ancestors did. However, they have intermingled with Re'uyeli and other eastern peoples, which has had a noticeable influence on their culture and faith. Some Crathánori even regard Sura’el as a member of the Court!

In 1513, these became more regulated and accepted as an official medium of exchange. The government-owned gem mines on Gemisle controlled the supply, thus allowing the government to directly control the amount of tradeable gems in circulation."

Crathánori merchant ships, too, would spread out as far as the rays of the sun, trading in faraway places of the world. Crathánor would prosper greatly as a result and reach the zenith of its power.\n\nBut eventually, the sun must set, as the day cannot last forever. So too did Crathánor's independence come to an inevitable end in 1658. In the dark years that followed, the Crathánori patiently waited for the sun to rise again."

It was originally tasked with guarding the eastern border of the Kingdom of Dameria. Its knights were renowned lancers and participated in many tourneys and battles throughout the centuries, their fearsome charges shattering lines of infantry with ease.\n\nEver since the formation of Anbennar, the Order's status and importance diminished. The long years of peace in Anbennar meant that fewer and fewer knights joined it. Yet the Order served Dameria faithfully until the Lilac Wars. During that conflict, Vincen II síl Cestir, the Duke of Cestirande and Grandmaster of the Order, declared independence from Dameria and joined the Rose Party. In 1444 Lilac Wars were over and the Order was on the winning side, but only thanks to their betrayal of Dameria."

During the Interregnum, they were quick to join Dameria. Initially they supported the magocratic rule of Anbennar, then they joined the other nobles in the Wars of Rule. And lastly, they were among the fiercest supporters of the House of Silmuna, but nevertheless sided with the Rose Party in the Fourth Lilac War. This pragmatic yet dishonourable behaviour earned them few friends but many territories. Unfortunately, it did not result in the prettiest of borders."

Perhaps the most infamous such insult was recorded during the Battle of the Moon Council, when Duke Vincen II síl Cestir called Adénn "Skylance" Silmuna "Brokenlance of the Waning Moon".

But opposing them were the Vernmen of Galeinn, who shared their ambition. This rivalry lasted for countless years and showed no signs of stopping after the Lilac Wars. If anything, it became increasingly intense as the two countries battled for dominance over the river. Later on other countries got involved, yet Cestirande stubbornly fought on."

The Cestirander breed was versatile, sharing traits of both cold-blooded and warm-blooded horses. The Knights of the Long Lance rode on them during tourneys and battles while farmers used them as work horses. As the importance of cavalry on the battlefield diminished, the latter role would become increasingly important, and the horses were crossbred with cold-blooded ones to make them better draft animals. The Cestirander horses would become the engine of local production, plowing fields and hauling freight."

Yet they continued to diminish as technology developed and made lancers obsolete. Members of the order became little more than titleholders or low-ranking officers in the army.\n\nEventually, however, the Order did have its resurgence. The Dukes and Duchesses of Cestirande began to grant the title of knight to court officials and bureaucrats as a reward for exemplary service. This new generation of knights did not wield the lance, but the pen. The burgeoining paper industry of the Duchy's capital, Cestaire, grew to primarily fuel these new knights and their numerous writings."

Their power was absolute, and only an outside force could bring an end to their rule.\n\nAfter the unification of the Empire of Anbennar, many Cestiranders would work in the administration of the huge nation, becoming vital cogs of the sprawling bureaucratic machine."

In 1340, seeking influence within the Empire of Anbennar, King Davan I plotted to see his second son Valeran to marry and bring nearby Asheniande into the Corvurian domain. This backfired spectacularly, with the cadet House of síl Vivin-Asheniande maintaining its allegiance to Anbennar and with it the lands of Ravenhill and surrounds from Corvuria, sparking The War of the Pale Raven which Corvuria lost.\n\nAdopting the Pale Raven (the opposite of the Corvurian black) as their sigil, the síl Vivins of Asheniande has grown in power considerably since then, combining the harsh mentality of their elder house with the graces required to navigate the intrigues of Anbennarian politics."

Historians later dubbed this the 'Death Ring of Marrvale', with the tunnel formations that the troops used having a ring-like shape around the city of Marrvale."

Smaller dwarven holds and adventurer kingdoms had to pay hefty taxes in order to trade goods with each other. In the 17th century, however, the grand reopening of the Marrhold tunnel changed and boosted trade between dwarves and humans. Suddenly many Serpentspine dwarves found an alternative path for exporting and importing goods. Marrhold became a powerful trading hub whose markets were filled with all sorts of dwarven and humans goods, a reward for ending Amldihr and Er Natvir supremacy."

With an extensive system of waterways and dikes, eels starting their migration to the sea are directed into pools and shallow rice paddies, where they stay until harvest. These shallow rice paddies are also the perfect habitat for all types of waterfowl like swans, which, along with the aforementioned eels and rice, provide an excellent product for farmers to both eat and sell.\n\nThough likely originating as a happy accident, the act of eel farming has long since been mastered by farmers over the years, and their fields sparkle with the mottled spots of eels and pure white wings of swans alike."

Facing total annihilation from his experienced sun elven legions and countless auxiliaries, Shanyutian did the unthinkable. With a simple order, the precious dikes and levees that held back the destructive power of water were broken, unleashing a torrent. Merging with streams from other broken levees, the torrent quickly became a flood, a deluge, and finally, a frothing wall of water, turned brown with mud and rocks.\n\nWhat remained of Jaher’s first invasion forces were scattered, forced to trudge back through the broken and flooded remnants of rice paddies and fields.The generals of Shanyutian always have this tactic in the back of their minds, no matter how self-destructive it may be. For better to have to rebuild than suffer under the yoke of another."

Harimar returned home embarassed for amassing such a great host. They defeated any army they came across, and stole what meagre riches the land had.

To charge downhill, through fire and flame, and to clash with a foe that outnumbered you ten to one, was to be the last act of bravery... but Castellos saw otherwise.

At the base, shining brightly, is a circlet sculpted to depict the White Walls. Surmounting each tower of the circlet are statues of the gods of the Cannorian Pantheon, encrusted with innumerable jewels.

 G26_bulwark_desc:0 "To our east lies the massive, dark Forest of the Cursed Ones. The many ruined villages and scorched earth marks you will find if you venture within are a dour testament to the raw ferocity of those beasts. Yet, our castles still stand, a testament to the spirit of our people, and whenever invaders banded into hordes, we let them crash against our walls, repelling them every time."
 G26_amethyst_knights:0 "Amethyst Knights"
 G26_amethyst_knights_desc:0 "Knights are the pride of Ynnic society, and no knights are as skilled or valiant as the amethyst-clad knights hailing from Amacimst. Named after their bright purple cloaks and bardings, they trace their roots to the invasion of 1154, in the aftermath of which a small band of veterans seized the keep of Amacimst and turned it into their base of operations. These veterans guarded the east and led punitive expeditions into Cursed One territory, soon making a name for themselves as the bane of any would-be future invader."
 G26_torvare:0 "Never Another Torvare"
 G26_torvare_desc:0 "The invasion of 1154 left a massive stretch of ruins and destruction, the city of Torvare being completely erased from history and its population slaughtered by the Cursed Ones. Survivors from all across the Ynn soon made their way to Amacimst, yearning to join the knights so they could get revenge and prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again, working tirelessly to arm the knights and upgrade Amacimst into a castle. Even today, when the soldiers of Amacimst are about to enter battle, it is common to hear some of them shout "Never another Torvare!""
 G26_trials:0 "Show Trials for Monsters"
 G26_trials_desc:0 "One thing that separates us from beasts, is that we have justice. After particularly big and bloody campaigns against the Cursed Ones, the most fearsome and brutish of them would be brought back to our towns, chained and in massive cages, where huge crowds would gather around them and judges would read the list of their crimes. As far as history tells us, none of those monsters have been able to provide any moral justification or explanation for their cruelty, and thus all have been met with the harshest capital punishments."
 G26_adventurers:0 "Adventurer Hotspot"
 G26_adventurers_desc:0 "Every year, bands of adventurers stop by Amacimst, looking to venture east into the ruined colonies of the old Ynnic empire, or even further into the heartland of the Cursed Ones. Naturally, while we have no use for their services, as we already have our valiant knights, adventurers could be the ones enjoying our innkeeping and hospitality industry... which has existed for centuries now, allowing us to reap the rewards."

 G26_grandiose_jousts_desc:0 "When they aren't busy fighting for the safety of everything west of Amacimst, our knights love nothing more than to hone their prowess by jousting. We shall fund great tournaments, and invite knights from neighbouring realms to attend. Naturally, foreign knights will be ashamed seeing the elegance of our bardings and the shine of our armours, but we are gracious enough to concede foreign, poorer knights a fighting chance."
 G26_ban_ideas:0 "Ban Subversive Ideas"
 G26_ban_ideas_desc:0 "It seems that waves of physical invaders are not the only thing we have to fight off now. New, dangerous ideas are coming from the world below the Ynn River, brought by pioneers and adventurers who have settled on our frontier, calling for the abolition of feudal order and the institution of mob rule. Let it be known henceforth, that sharing any idea or even mentioning any of the forms of government or customs used by Cannorian barbarians, even just for academical purposes, is a subversive maneuver that calls for the most severe punishments."

 G27_ironhouses_desc:0 "Brelar's mountains, the Vers Argan, are home to the largest iron deposit along the Ynn River, and our people have specialized in mining and smithing since antiquity. While Malacnar also has a large iron deposit, they always jealously kept it to themselves, whereas weapons and armor made of Brelari iron can be found anywhere from Svemel to Abdrabohvi."
 G27_endurance:0 "Brelari Endurance"
 G27_endurance_desc:0 "Life on the steep slopes of the Vels Argan mountains makes for a hardy people, who can easily endure a forced march or two through harsh terrain, wearing light iron armours that protect the chest and thighs while leaving the joints free to move. Brelari warriors have always been noted for their stamina, and they played a vital role in the rise of the ancient Kingdom of Vareynn when in 312, during the battle of Drevonbost, together with Vareynn's soldiers they surrounded the larger Malacnari host and eventually wore them down to the last fighter."
 G27_republicanism:0 "Roots in Republicanism"
 G27_republicanism_desc:0 "The ancient people of the Brefineis, who inhabited Brelar a millennium ago, were not simple barbarians whom Vareynn civilized: they had a deep political system, in which village leaders were elected based on the approval of their peers, and those leaders would in turn elect one of them to temporarily lead a confederacy. It isn't a coincidence that a thousand years later, Vareynn and the rest of the Ynn have fallen into dynastic feudalism, while Brelar is still a republic."
 G27_brelar_watermill:0 "Rebuild the Brelar Watermill"
 G27_brelar_watermill_desc:0 "Water is the source of life for all the people on the Ynn River, in more ways than one. The river runs strong and great for as far as the eye can see, and the landscape is dotted by watermills that people built throughout the ages to harness a portion of its strength. The modern town of Brelar itself originates from a village built around a water-powered lumber mill, but of course no mere watermill can compare to the Great Ynnic Dams, built by master engineers of old who tragically lost their lives during the collapse of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nFortunately for us, some of them were miraculously escorted to safety here in Brelar, where their descendants live to this day, and it is with their help that we will complete our newest project: we will upgrade Brelar's watermill, to be made huge and out of gold, bringing prestige and respect to what is the symbol of our nation, as well as a crucial source of energy."

 G27_legacy_of_brelari_emperors:0 "Legacy of the Brelari Emperors"
 G27_legacy_of_brelari_emperors_desc:0 "From 761 to 840, the Ynnic Empire was ruled by a succession of Emperors hailing from Brelar. They passed many reforms in the administrative field, resizing the provinces to account for the shifts in fertility of the Ynn River, rooting out corrupt officers, standardizing the calendar and formalizing the distinction between central and provincial government. While the empire would erupt into a civil war between Sarda and Dolindhans fifty years later in 896 and begin its slow decline, none could say that it was Brelar's fault."

Let us use this moment as an opportunity to reassure everyone: there is no Order of the Mountain Eye. While there is historical evidence for an ancient group of spies and assassins who protected the Ynnic emperors and were based off the village of Brelarico, rumours that they have continued their operations to this day and are now serving the Brelari state are just that - a rumour."

Many kings and queens - and emperors before them - were awe-struck at the sight of our massive hedge-maze, nurtured since the sixth century After Flood by the care of our gardeners and the skill of our mages. Descending from Oberjon the Gardener Knight, the lords of House Yen Greb have dabbled with the craft ever since, which taught them patience and care, useful for plants, just as useful for people."

 G28_alliance_of_knightly_lords_desc:0 "In 1367, the Rzentur united into a single kingdom and marched to invade us. Grebniesth acted quick to call upon the aid of its neighbours: by appealing to their sense of honour and underlining the risks that a Rzentur invasion would bring to all of them, while also leveraging on decades of built-up amicality, we convinced the majority of Dolindha to act as one in the face of the Great Heathen Host. While nowadays Dolindha - and the Ynn at large - seems more divided than ever, it will be no challenge to mend some relations, or weave new ones."
 G28_knights_of_the_bush:0 "Knights of the Bush"
 G28_knights_of_the_bush_desc:0 "The Grebvitre - Bush Knights - may not be as ancient as the Knights of Vareynn and not as emblazoned as the Knights of Amacimst, but they have been just as decisive in protecting Dolindha. Riding a stockier northern breed and being experts of the terrain, the Grebvitre dutifully patrol the Nisargan border for any barbarian who would be as foolhardy as to approach. They are notorious for their ability to suddenly appear out of thick vegetation to launch devastating charges, breaking even the iron-clad Rzentur infantry and sending them reeling back into their hovels."
 G28_trading_with_the_tribes:0 "Trading with the Tribes"

If there is one thing they are not backwards at, however, is warfare, and particularly armour and weapon-smithing. We will establish contacts with some of their tribes, and provide them with extra food during harsh winters if they’ll be so kind as to let us borrow some of their weapons for our endeavors back south."
 G28_keeping_them_out:0 "...But Keeping Them out of Our Backyard"
 G28_keeping_them_out_desc:0 "Ever since the sixth century After Flood, the Rzentur have migrated into Ynnic lands, no doubt attracted by the prosperity and quality of living of our civilization. The states of Svemel, Pomvasonn and Juzondezan are a result of such migrations, being Rzentur realms on what was once Dolindhan land. Before any more Rzentur, new or old, gets the idea to invade us, we should act preemptively: many Old Rzentur tribes would like nothing more than to settle the lands of their cousins to the south, and some of our "traders" will make sure to provide them with the motivations and means to do so."

 G31_conquerors_of_the_known_world_desc:0 "Vareynn rules Dolindha, and Dolindha rules the Ynn. It was King Komerjon of Vareynn who slew King Vatrevid of Malacnar in personal combat and claimed the City of Warriors for himself, and through his successors Vareynn expanded to rule all the lands along the Ynn River, forging the Ynnic Empire spanning from Svemel the High City to Adbrabohvi by the End of the World."
 G31_blood_of_lukaus:0 "Blood of Lukaus"
 G31_blood_of_lukaus_desc:0 "The tradition of horse-riding in Dolindha traces back to the legendary King Lukaus, who was exiled from the Kingdom of the Mountain and went on to found many cities in the Ynn River Valley. In order to vanquish evil, and trample all those who would question his rule, he struck a pact with the feral antler horses of the Dolindhan forests, becoming Rogaispodhan - the Antler Lord, the first elf who was allowed to ride them.\n\nWhile Dolindhan horses have since become far more manageable and tamer through centuries of domestication, still today it is said that if a knight has a particular connection and affinity with his horse, he has "the Blood of Lukaus", and nowhere is the blood of Lukaus still as present as in Vareynn’s nobility."

While the Amethyst Knights of Amacimst are the ones who came closest to succeeding, they are but one of the many names we've heard. In order to keep up with this stream of challengers, mandatory training sessions will be scheduled, where our knights will be brought up to date with the latest fencing techniques, riding formations, and fighting tactics of the enemies. While improving their individual prowess, these exercises will also have the side effect of teaching them to trust their generals and readily follow orders."

 G31_harbingers_of_honour_desc:0 "The Ynnic Empire wasn’t forged only through fire and bloodshed. Some states, such as Brelar, joined Vareynn willingly, while others, like Stanyrhrada, were inherited through royal marriage. When King Komerjon annexed Malacnar, he cited how the Malacnari followed the strongest, which he had proven himself to be by slaying their king. When King Jeborad crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar to conquer southward, he did so coming to the aid of his allies in Stanyrhrada. Through the centuries, Vareynn gained a reputation as a just if firm ruler, and its citizens set the standard for what it meant to be honourable and civilized, a standard which lives on through the knightly virtue of today."
 G31_the_eternal_castle:0 "The Eternal Castle"
 G31_the_eternal_castle_desc:0 "A short ride north of Vareynn City, Vareynn Amac is the oldest castle in the Ynn. Originally built as a fortified military encampment, it was under the care of the Drevondarant dynasty - a cadet branch of the Imperial family - that it was restructured to be a permanent residence for the nobility. While it was able to host many jousts and feasts throughout the ages, gathering nobles from all the Ynn, the castle also withstood many periods of hardships, both financially and militarily, and thus its keepers learned to make the best with whatever limited resources they had."
 G31_legacy_of_king_emperor_joanseln:0 "Legacy of King-Emperor Joanseln"
 G31_legacy_of_king_emperor_joanseln_desc:0 "Ancient Vareynn was ruled with the help of an assembly of riders, originally meant to allow those too elderly to ride in battle to continue assisting the kingdom by providing the ruler with regency and advice. Over time the Assembly of Riders schemed to gain more and more power, even obtaining the ability to veto the King’s decisions and resolve on matters of state independently.\n\nIt was King Joanseln yen Dolin who, in the seventh century After Flood, saw to it that the assembly was limited back to its advisory role and proclaimed himself the absolute Emperor of the Ynn, and while he was assassinated only a year later, his daughter finished the job and put all conspirators to death in a most gruesome fashion. While ideas of insubordination and divided rule are long behind us, we will not hesitate to stamp them out again should the specter of mob rule ever show up again."

The hippodrome was thus left half-built, and to this day it remains as a stain on the city’s pride, with both the hippodrome and Vareynn being left in disrepair. No more! We will complete the hippodrome, rebuilding it from the ground up if necessary, and then there will be no more doubters: Vareynn will be back in business being the world’s capital."

Impervious to fire, the tree is said to be old as the Ynn itself, and will impart its wisdom on any soul kind enough to write a poem for it.

Scarily large and unapproachable even to the most seasoned foresters and pure-hearted souls, the secret to ride them has been jealously passed down Drevkenuc's ruling line, and while Drevkenuco rulers are disqualified from riding them in jousts, nobody can contest that the sight of a Drevkenuco lord atop one of those massive creatures is a truly astonishing sight to behold."

While the most common destinations for this trip are Vareynn and Arverynn, the most daring youth have ventured all the way to the ruins of the old Mountain Kingdom occupied by the heathen Rzentur, the endless plains of the Epednar, the dark forest of the Cursed Ones, or even the northern wastes populated by Ice Sleepers, bringing home powerful artefacts and becoming men along the way."

No more! It was King Vylaron of Vareynn who made our ancestors see the errors of their ways, and ever since our conversion in the fourth century After Flood we have been quick and proactive in stamping out any form of heathenry, just like King Vylaron did, by having every village - no matter how small or secluded - presided by the watchful eye of a river inquisitor."

The weakest victims convulse and scream ripping at their skin only a few minutes after Leak has entered their bloodstream, while the strongest are slowly driven insane over the course of days or weeks as their family watches.

Particularly fruitful was the trade of lamp oil and ropes made from the fat and leather of mighty Dolindhan animals, and bombs, the manufacturing of which saw a small boom in the Bridge-Town of Bosancovac.

With it, the holy priests could witness the underside of the Holy Ynn River, marvelling at the riverbed's creatures and vegetation, and enticing their fellow citizens with the stories of what they had seen after they had surfaced. Soon, it became a common custom among Bosancovaco citizens to pool their life savings into affording a ride on the submersible... the experience of a lifetime."

 H25_old_walls_of_amstenur_desc:0 "East of modern Stenurynn are the ruins of Amstenur, the Walled City of the Sarda, an ancient principality with few equals. Its namesake walls were taller and sturdier than even the Great Ynnic Dams of today, and endless assailants and refugees would chip away at them in the hopes of one day breaking in.\n\nIn the sixth century after Flood, Amstenur finally met its end after a two-decades-long siege coinciding with the arrival of the Dolindhans. Its walls were thus dismantled, their stone taken away and used to build the Great Ynnic Dams of today, as well as our castle in Stenurynn. And while our lordship is still far from reaching the glories of ancient Amstenur, we have at least a convenient source of building materials."

Taking place in 628, it was meant to legitimize the governorship of Lord Calsanqir, who had been entrusted the territory of Stenurynn by Empress Zeldja I as a reward for his loyalty during the quashing of the rebellion ensuing from Joanseln’s assassination.\n\nWhile initially many scoffed at the mixed marriage, the Empress herself attended it, and the following century would see many more such unions bloom. However, House yen Stenur, created in 628 from the Riverwall Marriage, is and will always be the first Dolindhan-Sarda dynasty."

On that shrine is an inscription celebrating Adrahel, a famous healer who lived between the ninth and tenth century After Flood:\n\n"Friend or foe\nWith the blessing of the River\nYou shall die another day."\n\nAn adept student of herbs and medicine, he saved the lives of many soldiers and knights who would’ve otherwise died in battle. However, he was ultimately executed by Emperor Calrodiy II for failing to extend the lifespan of the ailing emperor, and many of his discoveries were then banned from publication. Recently, a hidden chamber has been found within the shrine, containing Adrahel’s notes: while some of those are outdated for modern medicine, others may just prove vital in saving the lives of our people."

Having been transmitted orally for generations, the story of Arkanvyr was finally put down on paper in the fifth century by the will of prince Valmynn of Amstenur, with later authors rewriting it and expanding it.\n\nIn some versions of the tale, Arkanvyr is a noble hero who strives to prevent the Ending Flood only to tragically fail, while in others, it is the fatal flaws of Arkanvyr and his companions that cause the Ending Flood in the first place. Other authors have chosen to ignore the matter of the Ending Flood completely, focusing instead on Arkanvyr’s bravery and ingenuity in the face of unknown monsters and hardships, a bravery which has inspired many a Ynnic knight to do great deeds such as the slaying of the Rzentur dragon."

Rather than competing for championship, the Knights Oathkeeper have thus decided to serve as law-enforcement, flying their white banners and drapes across the forested countryside as they deter any aspiring brigant and rabble-rouser from disturbing the peace. And while other knights may mock this relatively placid lifestyle, isn’t peace what all true warriors strive for?\n\nIn 1721, at the Battle of Delanydon Crossing, the Knights Oathkeeper finally took up arms yet again - but not the arms everyone expected, for they began unleashing deadly volleys of pistol fire upon the enemy lines before their charge, in a devastating combination of Tellumtiri gunmanship and Ynnic chivalry."

Bukka Raya, however, succeeded, and forest blooms in the desert even to this day. He returned just in time to oppose the ancient Larankarha, who had killed his father.

Meanwhile the so-called Knights of Lorent, who believe they live in some child's fairy tale, prance around their vineyards wearing gaudy armor and tabards. We Eaglecresters know that war is no game to be played by barely-trained oafs or noble fops and train our knights for true battle; for the honor of a knight truly lies in achieving victory"

 A52_the_western_eagle_desc:0 "Once, the banner of Eaglecrest flew high over the western coast of Lencenor, the last of the Alenic realms in the west. That came to an end when the craven, underhanded whelps of Iochand lured those savage thugs from the north to pillage and ravage our blessed country. Despite this shame, our neighbors still remember the days when Eaglecrest was a mighty kingdom and can't help but respect its might."

While it stands as a proud symbol of Alenic strength now, in days long past it was a Castanorian bastion, and a border fortress of the Gnomish Hierarchy before that. While the gnomes may be conniving shrews, the fact that their ancient foundations still support our modern capital might serve as proof that they have some worth after all."

 H75_idea_3:0 "The Seat of Goblinkind"
 H75_idea_3_desc:0 "Though conquered by orcs originally, Er-Natvir has has been home to goblins for centuries after the orcish armies moved on to siege other holds. In that time, the hold became a place of great importance to goblins, drawing them from all over to seek safety and fortune within. Because of this, the modern Railskulker clan is made up of goblins from many different origins who arrived at Er-Natvir at one time or another. Our shared kinship with many clans gives us a leg up in diplomacy."

 I98_all_goblins_home_desc:0 "Long ago the Cave Goblins lived in harmony, but then the Dwarves attacked. Driven not ust by greed, but by a hatred of all thing unlike them, the dwarven menace destroyed the old tribal kingdoms of the cave goblins and pushed them to the edges of the Dwarovar.\nIt was there that they festered for millenia. Through dwarven wars, outside invasions, and orcish hordes, the founding of Ves Udzenklan proved the strength of goblins over dwarves. And its endurance will prove that everything dwarves can do, goblins can do better."

One cannot go a night in an Udzenklanovic city ithout hearing the boom of some contraption malfunctioning, the roar of a drugged up horde of goblin super soliders, or the mad cackling of a goblin who has thought of a way to turn their enemies into a pile of goo."

He was prepared for this and quickly moved to have her ships surrounded, but Mykx skillfuly manuevered around the Viakkoca fleets at every opportunity she had and managed to escape with her followers to Aelantir.

Many have accused us of being the cause of these disappearances, citing the fact that our islands lie right in the middle of the triangle, or that ships looking suspiciously similar to those that vanished have been seen in our navy. These accusations may be accurate, but no one needs to know about that."
 G93_equal_opportunity_slavers:0 "Equal Opportunity Slavers"
 G93_equal_opportunity_slavers_desc:0 "The Cannorian colonies employ slave labor to work their fields, but their approach to it is much too narrow-minded. They only enslave orcs, and while orcs make fine workers, why limit yourself like that? Gnolls have always had a more 'egalitarian' approach to slavery. Humans, Orcs, Elves, Ruinborn, and anything else we can get our hands on are all fair game to become our slaves, and the increased supply of slaves will allow us to be more productive than our competitors."
 G93_home_of_outcasts:0 "Home of Outcasts"

They must already be desparate to come to us, so we should take advantage of that desparation to get them to put their skills to use for us for much cheaper than normal. It's not like they have much choice in the matter, they have nowhere else to go, and if they refuse to work for our prices, we can always force them to work in a different way instead."

Most famous of these is a special drug nicknamed Demon's Blood, produced only in Ilzin Mykx with a secret recipe. Perhaps more important than the black market trade, however, is the fact that this makes it easy for us to keep some of the products for ourselves..."

Funded by the profits of the local salt mines, this order attracted those knights who favored boldness in tactics over personal bravery and prowess.\n\nEventually, as the Kingdom of Verne declined, the knightly order would crown its Grandmaster as a sovereign duke, later becoming a direct vassal of the Damerians.

Knowing well the laws of supply and demand, they have realized that in order to sell things, those things must be made. Usmaklan workshops are guarded from disruption on a full time basis, and harsh penalties are enforced on goblins whose squabbles interfere with productivity.

 H89_idea_2_desc:0 "Before the Greentide hit Escann, the goblin slave Rurnor Snotfinger lead a group of fellow goblin slaves into the nearby caverns, avoiding the fate of those who became the Common Goblins. Every goblin of SLozklan knows this well, and knows the truth of why there can never be peace with orcs. They must die. Because of this, many humans turn a blind eye to Slozklan's wars against Orcish kingdoms in Escann."
 H89_idea_3:0 "Free goblins All"

However when the orcs rallied, they pushed the Slozklan armies all the way bac to Steelhyl. General Mit entrenched the SLozklan armies upon the hill, and cleverly baited the commander of the orcish left flank into attacking before the rest of the orcish army arrived. The glorious victory won there that day paved the way for Slozklan's purge of orcs from Inner Castanor"

Thankfully his daughter and lab assistant, Nopels, realized that the invention could still have applications. It is now used to help Slozklan soldiers run down retreating enemies.

Gazdalk the White, who showed the Dwarfs of Gor Burad that magic still meant something against the might of industry. All these and less legendary figures have lead the armies of Divlklan.

The Caseáns once again guard our villages and townships, while in the woods our men and women work hard to supply timber to the Whistlevale.

 Y00_first_unifier_of_haless:0 "First Unifier of Haless"
 Y00_first_unifier_of_haless_desc:0 "While Harimar managed to conquer the Rahenraj and Yanshen, he and his descendants never had success, or want (due to the lack of high temples) to conquer the rest of Haless properly. Jaher, however, did not have those limitations. By the time of Jaher's death in 1127 the Phoenix Empire stretched from Bulwar to Tianlou to Arawkelin, and even the stalwart kingdoms of the Sikai were in talks of joining the empire as a peaceful partner.\nWith the resurgence of the Phoenix Empire in Haless, it is by right that Haless be united under a single benevolent entity once again."
 Y00_erlak_szel_dazal:0 "Erlak-szel-Dazal"
 Y00_erlak_szel_dazal_desc:0 "Meaning 'noblesse oblige' or 'nobility obliges', this phrase harkens back to the sun elven attitudes as benevolent and impartial rulers of the land. Because of their duty to rule and to protect, the sun elven people must be held to higher accountabilities and expectations. They must be a good force in the world, be kind and generous, and patient with even those that disobey you, and ultimately, be the embodiment of Surael in the world."
 Y00_sunrise_legions:0 "Jaerelic Legions"
 Y00_sunrise_legions_desc:0 "Formed in 1656 by an elite cadre of Righteous Path monks and Sikai warriors, the Jaerelic Legions became the modern version of Jaher's Phoenix Legions with one core difference: they accepted and heavily utilized non-elves. While this style was also adopted by the Jaddari, the legions of the Sunrise Empire proper focused in the collective values of the Halessi peoples and incorporated the ritualistic gestures of the Righteous Path in their drilling techniques, making them a fierce opponent in the field.\n\nTheir most famous technique was the 'Burning Dragon Technique', which was essentially a fire-and-advance tactic done at an incredibly fast pace, allowing an entire regiment to continously fire on the enemy whilst getting into melee range."
 Y00_equals_beneath_the_rising_sun:0 "Equals Beneath the Rising Sun"
 Y00_equals_beneath_the_rising_sun_desc:0 "Unlike his father, who dreamed only of conquest, and his sister, who dreamed of elven supremacy, Jaerel dreamed of a world united as one - regardless of race, creed or belief, which he espoused to a point in making the love of his life, the harimari princess Tataka, his primary wife. Unfortunately, Jaerel's stance was only seen as a failure to choose a side, which saw many of his allies from all sides abandon him.\nTimes have changed however, and as the world is led by the scions of Anbennar, a realm created to bring peace and equality, perhaps Haless will now see that All Are Equals Beneath the Rising Sun."
 Y00_rezan_zimhar:0 "Rezan Zimhar"
 Y00_rezan_zimhar_desc:0 "Rezan Zimhar. The Alliance of the Sun. Found and translated by scholars in the 19th century from a lost part of Jaerel's will, the Rezan Zimhar was a plan to essentially federalize the disparate and diverse cultures and religions of Haless into a united state which granted them great amounts of autonomy and privileges, in exchange for federal control by an impartial sun elven court. Assumed to be greatly inspired when Jaerel's alliances collapsed when he refused to choose a side (he chose unity, rather than being pro-elven, for example), which saw his allies return to nationalistic and cultural affiliations, he had hoped to present this proposal at Sarisung shortly before he was assassinated.\n\nNow that the Sunrise Empire shines ones again, perhaps Jaerel's ambition can now be realized."
 Y00_monks_of_the_weaving_palm:0 "Monks of the Weaving Palm"
 Y00_monks_of_the_weaving_palm_desc:0 "The sun elves brought with them arcane magic, a form of magic that was mastered through study and learning. Before that, most magic-users in Haless were either utilized chi (their spiritual energy) or were outcasts studying rough forms of arcane, druidism and other magics in the fringes of Halessi society.\n\nThe Monks of the Weaving Palm were a collection of sun elven magi, high philosophers and righteous path monks who apparently spent a hundred days and nights debating in High Temple of Tianlou debating the nature of spirits and magic.\n\nWhat they came up with was the concept of a magic that was described as 'the weave', something that one must connect with on a spiritual basis to master, not just through study. While the concept of 'the weave' never reached popularity, the Monks of the Weaving Palm proved incredibly deadly in battle, evoking arcane spells through movements and gestures akin to chi and cultivation practices, using nothing but their internal energies, the arcane 'weave' in the air, rather than spell reagents and components."
 Y00_we_all_lift_together:0 "We All Lift Together"
 Y00_we_all_lift_together_desc:0 "A common saying within the Sunrise Empire, possibly originating from ancient Yan proverbs, "We All Lift Together" was a slogan used during the industrialization initiatives of the Age of Artificery when many factories, funded by artificers and magnates, were created across Haless. It is said that the unity of the Sunrise Empire saw that every man, woman and child, regardless of race, all had a role in lifting up the empire - or in a factory's case, worked as one in an assembly line."  #needs work

 A55_city_of_valor:0 "City of Valor"
 A55_city_of_valor_desc:0 "Menibór is second only to Anbenncóst itself in terms of how many adventurers hail from our city. From Derwing to Aiscestir, hopeful heroes of the Eastern Dameshead and beyond flock to our inns and taverns to begin their lives as adventurers, forming powerful and prestigious companies such as the Menibór Free Company in the process."
 A55_arcane_wards:0 "Arcane Wards"
 A55_arcane_wards_desc:0 "During the Wars of Rule, the Magisters of Oldtower and the knights of Valiant Keep frequently clashed near our city, their magics risking the integrity of our walls on several occasions. To deal with them, small anti-magic wards were created to be mounted on the walls and worn by our warriors, allowing them to properly defend Menibór from the arcane chaos spreading around her."
 A55_bridgewine_and_boar:0 "Bridgewine and Boar"
 A55_bridgewine_and_boar_desc:0 "Nothing soothes a tired adventurer more than a serving of Bridgewine with a hefty sausage!"\n\nKnown more professionally as simply `Menibór`, it is a moderately strong red wine that is known for its spicy notes and high acidity - and has found strong favor amongst the bolder characters of Cannor."
 A55_the_free_city:0 "The Free City"
 A55_the_free_city_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Damerian Republic our city has been one that few can manage to hold onto for long. Several times Damerian and Vernman forces alike were banished from the city by the adventurer companies and embroiled in bloody wars to reclaim her. Even though we've settled into the Empire, our neighbors know well the lengths a Menibórian will go to for our continued autonomous status."
 A55_in_the_loop:0 "In The Loop"
 A55_in_the_loop_desc:0 "The Loop is the most famed tavern in the Luna Basin, only catering to the most legendary heroes, who frequently gather there to discuss happenings and glories abroad. The proprietors of the establishment are quick to inform us of anything of note that they hear, always ensuring the reach of our city council remains in The Loop."
 A55_riverstone_clan:0 "Riverstone Clan"
 A55_riverstone_clan_desc:0 "The dwarves of the Riverstone Clan were hired long ago to construct the many bridges that cross the Luna in our city, and they stayed behind to maintain them. As the city grew around their homes and workshops they expanded their influence, constructing virtually every structure in Menibór and operating as the city's primary architects and engineers to this day."
 A55_hall_of_the_gallant:0 "Hall of the Gallant"
 A55_hall_of_the_gallant_desc:0 "The dream of every adventurer from Menibór is to have their statues and names featured in the hallowed corridors of the Hall of the Gallant, a vast memorial dedicated to those heroes that lost their lives fighting for glory and justice. With names and busts dating back to before the Dragonwake, it is the most well known and respected edifice in the city."

 A61_tempering_ambitions:0 "Tempering Ambition"
 A61_tempering_ambitions_desc:0 "Bluehart has always been surrounded by ambitious lords, eager to feat upon the riches of the Luna. Many a would-be conqueror have been turned away from our city, though not through the sword, but through the power of words. Our officials are experts in negotiating peace and reconciliation even with the most belligerent warlords, keeping our people safe from the horrors of combat."
 A61_legacy_of_the_hartlord:0 "Legacy of The Hartlord"
 A61_legacy_of_the_hartlord_desc:0 "Our city was originally founded as a legionary camp of the 21st Legion of Dameria, also known as the Legion XXI Hart. When the Republic fell to the Dragonwake, the former commander took control of the situation, allowing panicked civilians to flock to his protection and enforcing stability across the suddenly lawless frontier. In time he became known as The Hartlord, a paragon of peace and law, and when the Kingdom of Dameria rose from the ashes of the Republic, he readily submitted the new city of Bluehart to their rule, dying in his sleep as peacfully as he reigned. We hope to continue his legacy, acting as a force for goodwill despite whatever horrors wrack the lands around us."
 A61_heart_of_the_luna:0 "Heart of the Luna"
 A61_heart_of_the_luna_desc:0 "With the exception of Port Munas, our city is the largest on the Luna River. A prime destination for trade flowing downstream from the Wexhills, Blueharter merchants have little trouble finding markets to trade with from the comfort of home."
 A61_cymcestir:0 "Cymcestir"
 A61_cymcestir_desc:0 "The old legion camp is known as the Cymcestir, though it hasn't been used for its original wartime purposes for quite some time. Ever since the reign of The Hartlord, the compound has been used as a diplomatic complex, providing comforting accommodations for foreign dignitaries and secure rooms for tense negotiations."
 A61_sons_of_the_21st:0 "Sons of the XXI"
 A61_sons_of_the_21st_desc:0 "Each member tracing direct lineage to the soldiers of the Legion XXI Hart, the Sons of the XXI are the brave sentinels of Bluehart, they alone are permitted to bear arms within city limits.

 A61_oloiegeanur_academy_desc:0 "The Cymcestir was expanded and converted into the Olóiegéanur Academy in 1604 as a result of simmering tensions within the fabric of Anbennar.

 Z03_bellacs_rock:0 "Bellac's Rock"
 Z03_bellacs_rock_desc:0 "The most unique and storied structure of Bellacaire is the looming fortress of Bellac's Rock, first built by the King of Verne, Bellac Vernid, in 587 AA as a border fortress against Dameria. For centuries it stood against the ambitions of the north, up until it was siezed from the Vernids in 917 AA, acting as a bastion against her original owners until it came under siege and occupation during the War of the Sorcerer King. Despite its long and tumultuous history, Bellac's Rock is as sturdy as ever, a mighty citadel that continues to guard the lands around it."
 Z03_free_city_confederation:0 "Free City Confederation"
 Z03_free_city_confederation_desc:0 "When the winds of war blew across the Upper Luna, Bellacaire organized a neutrality pact with her fellow Free Cities of the river. Though it was ultimately short lived, the brief moment of unity along the Luna is a goal every Bellacairey hopes to replicate, to forge a realm strong enough to protect itself from being pulled into the conflicts of others."
 Z03_battle_of_the_salt_and_lance:0 "Battle of the Salt and Lance"
 Z03_battle_of_the_salt_and_lance_desc:0 "Despite our city's declared neutrality in the Lilac Wars, in the final days of the conflict she became the site of a brutal, yet inspiring, battle. The treacherous Cestiranders, recently supporters of the Rose Party, charged towards the city while the Galéinni did the same, both powers seeking to sieze Bellacaire for their own ambitions. They met outside our gates, clashing in bloody melee while our own warriors took the field to defend the city. After four days and three nights, the invading forces were both forced to withdraw, for the guard of Bellacaire had ensured she would continue to stand free."
 Z03_lunawalk:0 "Lunawalk"
 Z03_lunawalk_desc:0 "Running along the Luna River, the Lunawalk is where most Damerians settled after the fall of Bellac's Rock, establishing a patrician district along the gentle and serene banks. Far from reach of the great shadow cast by the Rock and gently lit by the moon at night, it is the most prestigious neighborhood in the city."
 Z03_the_drabsburd:0 "The Drabsburd"
 Z03_the_drabsburd_desc:0 "On the other side of the city, far from the opulent abodes of the Lunawalk, the workshops and laboratories of the Drabsburd buzz and churn night and day. The strange gadgets and trinkets produced by the gnomes of the district are awe-inspiring to the populace, and the city government largely leaves the gnomes to innovate and invent at will, so long as they enforce safe practices and procedures."
 Z03_impartial_in_heavens_and_halann:0 "Impartial in Heavens and Halann"
 Z03_impartial_in_heavens_and_halann_desc:0 "In the end, it truly doesn't matter who rests upon the throne of the Regent Court, for all of us shall know for sure when we pass from this world. Here one can find Adeanics and Corinites living in peace, free from the dogmatic hatred that drives their religious compatriots to battle outside the city."
 Z03_pink_stripe:0 "Pink Stripe"
 Z03_pink_stripe_desc:0 "The horrors of the war between the Corinite and Adeanic Leagues has left countless refugees and orphans in its wake, and the majority of the Empire is content to let them suffer in silence. This will not stand for us. The Pink Stripe is an organization based in Bellacaire to assist and nurture those devastated by war and disaster, regardless of creed, allegiance, race, or otherwise. Already they've established charters across Anbennar, looking after those that have been left behind."

 A82_vernid_arsenal_desc:0 "To prevent complete Damerian domination of the seas the old kingdom of Verne had established a bustling arsenal in Napesbay. Though the kingdom might've fallen long ago the infrastructure still stands, allowing us to continue producing vessels at a rapid rate, albiet under a different liege."
 A82_brigands_bane:0 "Brigand's Bane"
 A82_brigands_bane_desc:0 "Pirates of the Damesneck know to steer clear of Napesbayer vessels, for many a villainous corsair has been sent the the sea floor by our guns over the centuries."
 A82_napesfleet:0 "Napesfleet"
 A82_napesfleet_desc:0 "For centuries Napesbay was the home of the secondary Imperial fleet, frequently referred to as the Napesfleet, mirroring Neckcliffe across the Damesneck. When the Lilac Wars came roaring however, we knew that the fleet would only serve to make us a target should it remain in the hands of the Emperor. Thus, when the order came for the ships to leave port our officials seized the ships, declaring them property of the city and chasing down the ones that attempted to flee. While the Silmuna were understandably upset, bigger problems drew their attention from us and the fleet of Neckliffe served well in our stead.\n\nFor most of the conflict anyway.\n"
 A82_pirluna_vineyards:0 "Pírluna Vineyards"
 A82_pirluna_vineyards_desc:0 "Along the gentle and slow-moving Pírluna are vineyards and wineries, tranquil slices of land owned by retired adventurers from Menibór. With a countryside more akin to the estate of a Wine Lord, they're one of the main employers in Napesbay, only after the arsenal and the navy."
 A82_napesbay_company:0 "Napesbay Company"
 A82_napesbay_company_desc:0 "Ruben of Napesbay was a daring and dashing captain, who led the colonial efforts of Verne, becoming one of the most explorers in Cannor. He of course didn't forget his home city, returning with gold and silver to establish a new colonial trading company in Napesbay, bringing trade from Aelantir back home."
 A82_gems_in_the_rough:0 "Gems in the Rough"
 A82_gems_in_the_rough_desc:0 "Many of the pirate captains the captains of Napesbay captures are quite skilled, and it would be a waste to not make use of their talents. By establishing a rehabilitation program we can turn these rowdy raiders into proud admirals of the Napesfleet, fighting to finally rid the sea of their former comrades."
 A82_rise_of_napesbay:0 "Rise of Napesbay"
 A82_rise_of_napesbay_desc:0 "With the Napesbay Company running well and the Napesfleet keeping the seas clear of piracy, Napesbay has swiftly grown into one of the most prominent ports in the Damesneck. Many of the adventurers and settlers flocking to Aelantir leave Cannor through our city, and countless more have been moving here to establish new businesses, at home and abroad. Truly, this is Napesbay's golden age."
