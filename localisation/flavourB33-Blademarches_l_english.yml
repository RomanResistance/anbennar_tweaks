 flavor_blademarches.2.t:0 "An Offer from the Blade Stewards..."
 flavor_blademarches.2.d:0 "Not even the Kingdom of the Blade could withstand the Greentide. But what did survive was the kingdom's titular sword and mark of rule: §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§!.\nThe Blade Stewards have seen you unite the lands of the old kingdom and have emerged from hiding to offer a chance to rule. The test is simple: fix your eyes on the blade and unsheath it from its scabbard. If you are worthy, you will see clear and true. If you are not, you will be blinded permanently.\n\nYou eagerly accept the test, and hold the covered blade in front of you. The scabbard has seen better days, but the hilt itself is exquisite.\n"It is made of dragonbone, with the pommel being the tooth of Alos the Copper himself," one of the Stewards says.\nYour lips curl into a smile briefly, but soon enough you remember what is at stake, and in a single motion, you pull the sword from the scabbard.\nYou hear stewards and courtiers around you wince in pain as if they were being blinded.\n\nBut you. Were. Not."
 flavor_blademarches.2.a:0 "Long live the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 
 flavor_blademarches.3.t:0 "Succession of the Gleaming Blade"
 flavor_blademarches.3.da:0 "The rulership over the Blademarches has always relied on one thing and one thing only: the Test of the Gleaming Blade.\nThe test is simple: fix your eyes on the blade and unsheath it from its scabbard. If you are worthy, you will see clear and true. If you are not, you will be blinded permanently.\n\nAs the nominal heir of the realm, [Root.Monarch.GetName], by tradition, has the first chance to take the test and prove themselves a worthy successor.\nOf course, if they wish, they are also granted two privileges: the right to find a bladechosen: someone else the blade deems worthy but acts as a champion for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Secondly, the right to train in the art of the sword with the Blade Stewards for a few years, if you need it, to ensure fair and stable succession... though others may not see it that way."
 flavor_blademarches.3.db:0 "The old [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been defeated and proven unworthy of §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§!!\n\nHave no fear, for their old champion, the bladechosen [Root.Monarch.GetName], has risen to bring control back to the realm, and more importantly: to lead just and true as a favoured of §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§!."

 flavor_blademarches.5.da:0 "The Blade Steward hands the legendary blade to you in reverence. You take §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§!, and inspect its magnificence up close. Its scabbard is made of hardened copper leather, patterned like dragonscales. Its guard is simple and straight, emblazoned with a jewel at the centre, no doubt polished damestear - what is interesting however, is that the guard is made of no metal... but dragonbone. Its grip looks to be made of the same material, wrapped diagonally with sturdy copper leather that is almost iridescent. But the most noticable thing of all was a single large tooth serving as the pommel, said to be taken from the dragon Alos the Copper himself.\n\nYou compose yourself, and grip the hilt with one hand, and the scabbard with the other, ready to unsheath the blade.\nYou fix your eyes at the border between hilt and scabbard, where the first flash of metal will be seen, or the first flash of blindling light, if you are unworthy.\n\nFor a split second you hear only the 'schwing' of a blade being drawn, but then, what follows is trademark blueish-grey ripples of precursor steel, and realise that you have passed the test."

 flavor_blademarches.10.da:0 "While [Root.Monarch.GetName] trains with the Order of the Blade Stewards, a pretender has risen claiming they are a worthier claimant of §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§!. After all, what kind of worthy leader has to train? You are either worthy or you are not!"
 flavor_blademarches.10.db:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] the Blind has always been seen with embarrassment by those who swear fealty to §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§!, and now a pretender has risen seeking to place themselves as a worthy heir to §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§!. After all, why should a ruler that has been rejected by the blade be able to rule by a kingdom [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is not worthy for?"
 flavor_blademarches.10.dc:0 "The Kingdom of the Blade must be led by a Bladechosen King, not some scheming regent or regency council. A pretender has risen to claim §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§! for themselves."

Only the best of the best are to be admitted into the ranks of these so called Bright Hussars, named as such due to the light of Calindal reflecting off of their polished armour. Unlike leaders of other nations our Bladechosen king still rides to battle at the head of the army, which caused deaths of more than one great leader. With a proper training to fight beside a wielder of Calinal they will be able to protect the king from being swarmed."

 flavor_blademarches.14.t:0 "Colonizing the Folly"
 flavor_blademarches.14.d:0 "Having much expanded our southern border it has been brought to our attention that a group of merchants is willing to fund an effort to colonize and pacify the Folly, effectively bringing it under our rule and ending gnoll raids over our borders once and for all. This will however require great deal of preparations."
