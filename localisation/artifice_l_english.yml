Brilliance school artificers see themselves as the peak practicioners of the science of artifice. Their most prominent invention is the Sparkdrive rifle, being typical of their approach to artifice by blending technology and magic to create something entirely new and all the more capable."

 tec_technomancy_FACTION_DESC:0 "Represented by the School of Techno-Thaumaturges, the Technomancy school of artifice is followed by those who view artifice as a new school of magic. Creating inventions whose effects would not be out of place in a typical mage's university, artificers fo the Technomancy school borrow many of the time tested techniques and methodology of academic wizards. Their most famous invention are sending stones, placing what was once rare and difficult magic into an mass produced form capable of causal use."

 tec_machinery_FACTION_DESC:0 "Represented by the League of Mechanists and Tinkerers, the Machinery school of artifice focuses on applying artifice to improve mundane inventions. While they do not disdain some of the more fantastical applications of artifice, they believe that artifice should be as mass produceable as possible, and that grounding it in practical engineering is the path to truly groundbreaking inventions. The school takes its name from the praxis of it's most famous invention, skyships, which show the sort of things that can be achieved with the school's engineering focused approach."
