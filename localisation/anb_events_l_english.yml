 eordand.3.d:0 "With the conquest and destruction of Pelodard, the Domandrod Fey have lost their most loyal subjects. A message arrived in your palace in the midst of the night upon your table, written on a curious silky paper and with gracefully curving script. Despite the beautiful penmanship and sweet words, they are outraged by your actions, demanding your presence and explanation for your actions. Their call is not one to be denied. \n\nYou travel from Arakeprun with a small entourage, ready for the long journey to the Domandrod. You pass from the grandeur of Spring Court cities to the hinterlands in the east. Here the trees grow thick, and civilization sparse. Watching from above on the treetops, the Peitar look at you accusingly. Your loyal guards look around suspiciously with polearm and bow ready in hand, primed for threat to your person. But harm never comes to you, and before long even the homes of the Peitar dissapear into the deep forest of the Domandrod. The air is still and the glades calm, but all feels as tense as a drawn bowstring. Your journey is not over yet, but in this moment you hesitate and ponder over yourself. What is it you truly want, what is guiding your actions? It cannot be a mere whim that you wake every day, every day that you command the fates of countless souls? \n\nYou command your caravan to stop for a rest by a small spring glistening from the sunlight that has pierced through the twilight of the Domandrod. While the camp is set up you walk over to the pond with your personal guard Nestrin. You gaze into the still but clear water disturbed only by placid butterflies, you gaze into your reflection and truly realize who you are. \n\nThen you see in the reflections of the water an enchantingly beautiful woman draped in vines and a crown of rose thorn. Turning around, you see a monstrously huge man with a grotesquely horned mask, like a mass of antlers in every direction. The woman speaks to you with an unnerving smile. \n\n"What have you seen in the pool? Not all who enter the forest come here, but those who do always have a guilty conscience. I know that you are a leader most powerful, that your every word is one that carries great weight. So tell me, O great leader, what words will you say today?

You feel a tug in your mind, a hunch, and turn around. Behind you is a shadowy figure, contrasted against the magical lights bathing your balcony. Clutched in its tenebrous hands you see a small but wickedly shaped dagger. \n\n"Are you prepared to answer for your crimes?," a graven, solemn voice utters.

In my silken nightrobe I roused the court, and ordered an investigation into this legend. True enough, after extensive dredging of sand, more of these substance was found: none other than Damestear itself. But most importantly, the source was found, a buried ruin beneath the sands. Inside a long forgotten chamber was used by the Precursors to summon forth Damestear into our very own land. Although the art long defunct, the latent power of this facility can still be utilized to extract some Damestear, as long as energy still remains."

He failed in his mission, and confidence was forever lost in the Oathsworn, leading to even the Peitar peoples splitting off into different states.

Sidpar has struggled against the Summer Court realms, and would do well to gain an advantage against them. Should we offer them a deal, offering them support in eradicating the Summer heretics of Dearktir?

Now that our wars have ended and we are now allies, and we realize the pain that we have caused on our cousins, we should consider our ownership of the land. Pelomar offers us acknowledgement of our supremacy over the realms of the south along the Sarmadfar, including support in war against the heretic Caamasi, in exchange for Colltin.

The Ruinborn were quickly understood, as our shipboard scholar on Elven language was able to interpret them well enough. Calling themselves the 'Tuathak,' and the land 'Eordand,' they welcomed us to a banquet held in our honour. More alike the familiar elves than the other Ruinborn, we were quick to trust them. How wrong we were. It appears that we must have slighted them somehow, as our food was poisoned, and our ships seized.

The Silmunas were the Grand Dukes of Dameria joining the Empire of Anbennar, and were the dynasty most frequently on the imperial throne - some even viewed the Silmunas as the only rightful rulers of Anbennar. The dynasty was destroyed following the Lilac Wars, when the Grand Duchy of Dameria was dissolved after the victory of the Rose Party and the Silmunas lost their territories save for a Rose-aligned branch in Wesdam. Of the dynastic branch that once ruled the Grand Duchy, only Rogier Silmuna survived as Captain of the Sons of Dameria adventurer company.

Lorent remained independent of the Empire of Anbennar, though eventually a Siloriel managed to be elected to the imperial throne, sparking the Lilac Wars.

 zabyostlar.1.t:0 "The Twin Cities of Zabyos and Tlar"
 zabyostlar.1.d:0 "As the city grows, the difference between the high and lower classes in Zabyos'tlar has become all too visible. The city has grown up and over the canal, bathing the lower districts in darkness while the Zabyos'tlaric elite thrive high above. With this divide the city has become known as two, the grand and opulent Sky Walk of Zabyos above and the filthy, darkened Undercity of Tlar below."
 zabyostlar.1.a:0 "At least I don't have to mingle with the rabble anymore."
 lake.104.t:0 "A Worthy Capital"
 lake.104.d.1:0 "Through the blood of our militia and the sweat of our workers we have risen to great power. As our great Federation continues to ascend and reclaim our ancient homelands, we're confronted with a conundrum. The unity of our islands has led to many clamouring for a proper seat for our administration, worthy of our glory. Hundreds of cities, large and small, have submitted requests that they become the seat of power. We have narrowed this extensive list to but a few, the most historically significant taking clear precedence. Our options are as follows; old and unwavering Raattakod, bulwark of the Westmarches, the Twin Cities of Zabyos and Tlar, whose canal allowed our people to thrive, mighty Qarshtuluu, the greatest city in the islands, or far reaching Zurkanrek, for eons our sole link to the outside world. Another choice presented by our magnates is to build an entirely new capital upon the golden island of Ultakal, keeping our government in the center of an extensive production chain. Finally, we could just keep the capital where it stands. Whatever our choice, our people are ready to carry out extensive expansions to our grand capital."

 lake.104.b:0 "I've heard the Sky Walk is lovely this time of year."
 lake.104.c:0 "Of couse gleaming Qarshtuluu should represent our people."

 ogre.1.t:0 "Reign of Ziltagh"
 ogre.1.d:0 "The great kingdom of the Fathide Ogres, Maghargma, had long fallen into decadence. The King resided within his palace, gorging himself of feasts gathered from Centaur tributes while his warlord vassals ruled their lands unapposed, paying little more than lip service to their liege. When the Centaurs attacked the kingdom suddenly and the king fell in battle, the mighty Ziltagh rose to the throne, leading our people to victory and reaffirming the power of Maghargma over the warlords. While they may still desire their freedom, while Ziltagh rules from his throne none dare to rise against him."
 ogre.1.a:0 "Long may Ziltagh reign!"
 ogre.2.t:0 "Why are you seeing this?"
 ogre.2.d:0 "Northern Fathide Ogres hate each other yo."
 ogre.2.a:0 "Word, I feel that."
 ogre.5.t:0 "The Place of the Clans"
 ogre.5.d:0 "The clans of Maghargma have long been a great boon and a terrible curse upon the land. On one hand, their close connections to the lands they rule over allow them to govern them with greater efficiency than we ever could from Maghargma. On the other hand, their loyalty is not guaranteed, as the last few centuries have shown. As we gather the greatest of the clans in the capital to announce their place in the new order of the Empire, we must come to decision as to whom the people should look to as their direct rulers."
 ogre.5.a:0 "We cannot trust them, the people shall look to us for guidance."
 ogre.5.b:0 "Now is the time for the clans to show their loyalty."
 ogre.6.t:0 "Owners of the Land"
 ogre.6.d:0 "As we ponder how to decide who should rule over the villages and rural areas of our Empire, we've come to two choices. Either we hold grand festivals of brawling and bloodsport to find the strongest within a village, granting the victor the right to the land, or we pass the villages to be ruled by prominent families in the area, effectively creating a caste of lower clans. While appointing strong warriors to rule would greatly improve the martial spirit of our people, utilizing local families would grant stability and wealth to the lands they rule over."
 ogre.6.a:0 "Only the strongest shall rule our people. Let the games begin!"
 ogre.6.b:0 "We should annoint lesser clans to ensure prosperity in the Empire."
 ogre.7.t:0 "Nature of our Warriors"
 ogre.7.d:0 "In an effort to project our status as a powerful and united Empire, many of our advisors have pushed for a reformation of our warbands. While the raging horde of hungry Ogres, eager to devour anything that stands in their way, may have been the prime weapon for ages, they claim that organizing the hordes under the strict guiding hands of powerful warlords would greatly improve the ability of our army, even if we must suffer in terms of how much manpower we can field."
 ogre.7.a:0 "The Hordes have served us well, and will continue to far into the future."
 ogre.7.b:0 "We must rally our forces into a disciplined force to project our might."
 ogre.8.t:0 "The Blackhand Missive"
 ogre.8.d:0 "We have recieved a rather poorly composed letter from the Ogre realm to the west. Though it took some time, we've realized that it is an ultimatum; they demand that we submit to their rule or, as they put it, earn an honored position at their feasting hall. The missive has inspired both anger and terror within our city, as the Ogres, while crude and ill-mannered, are quite powerful. They're expecting a response, and it would not be in our benefit to make them wait."
 ogre.8.a:0 "We have no choice but to kneel."
 ogre.8.b:0 "We shall never submit to those gluttons!"
 ogre.9.t:0 "The Human Response"
 ogre.9.d:0 "The humans of the Federation have sent their responses back, they have been gathered to present to the Menghurkha at his discretion."
 ogre.9.a:0 "Let us see."
 ogre.10.t:0 "Mining in Maghargma"
 ogre.10.d:0 "Our prospectors have successfully reopened the mines surrounding the capital, and have already discovered new veins to harvest from."
 ogre.10.a:0 "What have they brought from the depths of the earth?"
 ogre.11.t:0 "The Kelaktar of [Root.GetName]"
 ogre.11.d:0 "After years of hard work the fortifications of our capital are complete, the walls have been repaired and dozens of war halls have been constructed to house our warriors."
 ogre.11.a:0 "A true sign of our might."
 ogre.12.t:0 "Great Kelaktar"
 ogre.12.d:0 "One of our subjects has expanded their Kelaktar into a massive and bustling fortress city that many claim to rival Maghargma itself. While this is clearly a bold exaggeration the effect it has had on our prestige is clear. The greater factions frequently gather within the walls of the Great Kelaktar to meet behind closed doors and scheme, and it is clear that out position is now tenuous at best."
 ogre.12.a:0 "Worrisome."
 ogre.13.t:0 "Great Skurkokli"
 ogre.13.d:0 "Our Clan has properly moved to the great glade found to the north, the villages of the old lands have been dismantled and the resources repurposed to build a new home for the horde. Thousands of tents now fill the once serene glade with the sounds of feasting and battle as our people settle into their new lands and prepare to conquer more territory for the $DYNASTY$ Clan."
 ogre.13.a:0 "A true home for Ogres."
 ogre.14.t:0 "Prepare for War"
 ogre.14.d:0 "We have raised our forces and readied our clansmen for war, now all that must be decided is how we plan to manage this war. We could either confront the residents of Amldihr in their homes, attacking their mountain with the full might and fury of our people to ensure peace and security within our swamp. On the other hand we can lure them out of their caves and tunnels to crash upon our walls and be claimed by our bogs."
 ogre.14.a:0 "We shall take the fight to them!"
 ogre.14.b:0 "They shall rot in our swamps!"
