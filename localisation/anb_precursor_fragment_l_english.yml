 fragments.1.t:0 "The Glowing City Legend"
 fragments.1.d:0 "Your explorers stumble upon a rather hidden temple. Inspecting the temple leads to the discovery of lines of silver in the floor, different stones as walls and floor like white feldspar, malachite and limonite and an obsidian ceiling with white, yellow and red gems. Around the centre column is a city drawn with Damestear and it seems like it’s falling from the sky. “This is a map!”, one of the men exclaims. “Look, the different stones are terrains: woods, shores, swamps,... and the lines are probably rivers and the gems form constellations.”"
 fragments.1.a:0 "Maybe he’s right and this a map to a city from the stars."

 fragments.101.t:0 "The Scaled Beast"
 fragments.101.d:0 "As your troops move through the undergrowth they hear a scream of panic and pain. Rushing to the origin they find a native entangled by a giant snake. Your adventure captain steps in quickly, draws his sword and beheads the scaled beast. The man starts to thank him exaggerated but suddenly stops as his vision falls upon the sword. Excitement takes over his face and he jumps up and gestures at the Damestear pommel of the captain’s swords and then urges him to follow. He leads the men to a nearby village and brings them to his elder. After talking to him and gesturing to the sword the elder starts to speak. One of the translators steps forward and says: “He asks if we have been to the Glowing City, if it has risen again.” “Maybe he talks about the city from the temple. Ask him what he knows.” The elder tells a story about his ancestors who went to the Glowing City and came back as gifted beings, but the city angered the gods and one day got swallowed by the earth."
 fragments.101.a:0 "Let’s ask for the way their ancestors took, we need to follow it."

 fragments.102.t:0 "The Ruin"
 fragments.102.d:0 "For days nothing really happens. The troops follow the way and once in a while they see one of the landmarks. Confidence rises as more men start to believe in the city that descended from the sky. For months they went through this unknown frontier without a real goal in sight and even the temple didn’t convince most of them. But every matching detail from the elder’s story strengthens their trust and therefore their will to march on. Suddenly they run into a strangely barren circle with a ruin on a hill in the middle. Nothing grows within the circle, there is only plain dirt. Even the clouds seem to pass around this place. As the first men step into the circle they feel like walking through a waterfall. On the other side they are met with total silence. Not a single sound from either the wildlife or the rest of their group can be heard. They quickly return to the outside and report their observation. Some of the rather superstitious men are starting to get restless and urge to leave."
 fragments.102.a:0 "This place doesn’t feel right. We should leave it as soon as possible."
 fragments.102.b:0 "The ancestors must have been here, maybe we will find some more clues for the city."

 fragments.103.t:0 "Words on the Wall"
 fragments.103.d:0 "The way of the ancestors approaches its end and the pathfinders think the area matches the depiction from the temple. The adventure captain and his advisors debate how they should proceed to find the city in this untamed land. They get interrupted by a heavy thunderstorm. Luckily there is a big cave nearby and all of the men and animals can fit inside. While they wait some men go into the deeper parts of the cave. Panicked shouts from the deep alerts the adventure captain and his guard. As they draw their weapons and approach the men they nearly fall into a pit full of bones. The men stare down upon what seems to be the remains of hundreds, not only men, but women and children too. Someone carved crude elven words into the wall: “Here rest the murder of Aesair (sky city). Slaughter by those too blind to see.” This should be the name of the city the men are trying to find and a purge of its whole population would explain why it got lost. No one feels comfortable at a mass grave and they leave as soon as possible."
 fragments.103.a:0 "We are close enough to see the glow of the city, only travel at night now so we can see it."

 fragments.104.d:0 "The men found nothing. The city should have been around here, maybe it returned to the stars again. The adventure captain decides to abolish the search and return to the systematic mapping of the new world."

 fragments.105.t:0 "Piles of Damestear"
 fragments.105.d:0 "Soon some men find the first chunks of Damestear and, after concentrating the search in this direction, they find more and bigger chunks and finally enter a valley with a ghost town. However this is definitely not a city from the stars. A quick inspection makes it obvious that this a big mining town for Damestear and it never depleted. "
 fragments.105.a:0 "Not what we came for but it’s a huge amount of Damestear anyway."

 fragments.106.d:0 "On a giant open space the men find strangely round hills. As they approach the magically gifted among them gets a massive headache and strange hallucinations. When he recovers he urges his companions to get the adventure captain. He and his advisors inspect the hills and his chronicler quotes the elders story: “And the angry gods awoke the earth and made it swallow the Glowing City”. So maybe we find the domes under these.” The adventure captain agrees and orders his men to dig at the first hill. After a few hours they bump into Damestear and a few minutes later uncover a whole railing. There are definitely buildings under these hills."
 fragments.106.a:0 "The Glowing City is real and we found it. Continue the digging, free it from the earth."
 
 fragments.2.t:0 "Realm of the Hidden Dragon"
 fragments.2.d:0 "It is said that in a time before the Precursor Empire… was an age known as The Rule of Dragons.\n\nA time where the elven people were slaves to the Dragon Scions, who warred amongst themselves for hegemony over Aelantir… until a member of the Dragonguard, elite warrior-slaves taught magic to fight on their master’s behalf, decided to act – killing their draconic master. This hero was known as Venaan, who is said to be the originator of the word ‘elven’ in the first place (meaning of Venaan), and with his act of defiance more and more Dragonguard began to overthrow and kill their masters, leading to mass rebellion across Aelantir.\nWith magic harnessed by the Dragonguard and the will of the elven slaves across the continent, the tyrannous dragons were beaten and wiped to near extinction: the rest were said to be cursed to become mindless beasts and wander the world… except one.\n\nAmadian myth speak of ancient warriors who fought to protect their ‘scaled master’ from ‘a war of bonds’. It is said these ancient warriors appeared once again with their master during the Day of Ashen Skies, and rescued those they deemed ‘pure of heart’ to take the master’s hidden realm. \nLike most stories, it shows a grain of truth – but our mages have confirmed that the magical auras in Amadia seem to concentrate at some parts of the region one day, and the next, disappear. If this is this alleged realm of the last dragon the legends speak of, who knows what knowledge and riches we could find?"

 fragments.201.a:0 "Perhaps the highest point we can find?"
 fragments.201.b:0 "At the centre of the region, of course"
 fragments.201.c:0 "Among the local tribes"
 
 fragments.202.t:0 "Hidden Dragon: Massive Surge!"
 fragments.202.d:0 "A surge of magic has been detected in $PROVINCENAME$.\nFrom a layman’s eyes it was nothing but a large clearing in the jungle, but to us: it was proof. It seems our observation posts did not simply track this alleged hidden realm, but also tampered with the stability of its movements – and caused something to leave tracks. The soil was not of this region. The rocks were scattered as if thrown by force in all directions, but most importantly… a single spear found buried in the ground.\n\nThe spear was clearly more advanced than the ruinborn were capable of. When shown to archaeologists they could see clear precursor origins, but they noted that some parts of the spear were newer than the rest. The shaft was made of strange wood unlike any we’ve seen in Amadia, and was dated to be only ten years old. The spearhead was much older, of course, and bore the mark of precursor steel, but with one caveat: it had the signs of frequent care. \nBut the most important thing was what the mages said: it had a strange lingering scent of magic. One that was not of this plane. What we do with this spear will no doubt determine our success."

We seem to have caught its attention, and in the recent months it seems to have stopped connecting to our plane.\n\nThe greatest mages and artificers in our employ suggest one final course of action: to feign the closure of our endeavours… and lay a trap. And when the time is right, we will bind this pocket plane into our own, restoring it to its natural place in our realm – and allowing our adventurers to finally enter this hidden realm.\n\nWe must act quickly."

 fragments.204.d:0 "We waited and waited, and nothing. It seems that this hidden realm has escaped our grasp.\n\nAs we dismantled our outposts a junior scholar reported seeing the shadow of a flying beast overhead, but no one else could confirm their findings. Perhaps the next adventurers will have better luck with the Realm of the Hidden Dragon."

 fragments.205.t:0 "Hidden Dragon: Assault on the Realm"
 fragments.205.d:0 "In what used to be a stretch of jungle was now a valley that looked like Amadia before the Ruin. A large paved path stretched across the valley to the top, with humble stone houses dotted by the roadside. At the very end of the road, up a mountain, was a grand palace with huge gates that welcomed all sorts of life in, and presumably, allowed a dragon to fly out.\nThe valley, however was empty. The houses looked lived in, but there was no one to be seen. Had they fled? It didn’t matter. The looting had already begun, and large contingents of our explorers began to enter the houses and carry back treasures to safer lands.\nOur main group crept their way to the palace and were greeted by the temple guards, who bore armour resembling those of the ancient Dragonguard that once liberated Aelantir. But behind them, was a sight stunned the adventurers. A dragon. Shiny and crimson, sprawled across the span of the entire palace floor.\n\nThe scaled beast spoke, and with each word, the land itself shook. "I bid you entrance to my haven, in hopes of answering your curiosity. But now I see I have been mistaken," the beast continued, and looked at one of our ruinborn guides. "For my people, the disaster has only been a hundred years ago, yet you bear the scars of a time beyond that. I pity you. For what your ancestors had done to my people, and what your ancestors have done to the world." The beast then returned its gaze to our explorer. "By temporarily binding my realm to yours, I have seen what fate has befallen the world, to Druzbhazinl, and I want nothing to do with it. SO BEGONE!"\n\nWith fiery breath most of our adventurers were extinguished, and those that were lucky managed to make it back out of the valley, and not a second later, it was gone, and the jungle returned to its place."

At the very end of the road, up a mountain, was a grand palace with huge gates that welcomed all sorts of life in, and presumably, allowed a dragon to fly out.\nOur adventurers poured into the valley and started looting. The inhabitants of the valley put up a resistance, but their spears were no match for our guns. Adventurers broke formation and stole all manner of things, from ornate artefacts to the clothes off the backs of the inhabitants and fled back to safer lands.\nThe core group fought their way to the grand temple and clashed with the temple guards, who flung strange magic at us, using their spears as spellcasting foci. They bore armour resembling those of the ancient Dragonguard that once liberated Aelantir, but in the end they were no match\n\n"You have meddled with our realm for thousands of years, since our saviour took us to his home, and now you invade? The day after he died?" one of the Dragonguard questioned, before being struck by a bullet. \n\nThousands of years? Our quest started a few years ago at best, but no Dragonguard survived to answer more questions. In the end, the palace was indeed empty of any dragon, but full of riches from an age that predated the precursors."

It is said that one could get lost in these woods just as one would get lost in the Deepwoods back in Cannor – perhaps even more so.\nIn the dead of night, the entire camp was woken up by what seemed like fireflies surrounding the camp – but no, it was fairies! These fey resembled miniature humans but with butterfly-like wings, and laughed with joy as they played pranks on the men – stealing trinkets as they buzzed above like bees.\n\n "You wish to find our queen? Look for a tree split between two worlds, dearie! Hee-hee!" one of them shouted.\n\n"No trust fey, captain," one our own men whispered. The man was of ruinborn stock, one of the cursed ones, brutish and imposing. "Fey in forest. Mean harm. They Dark. Unseelie. Look good, but actually, bad." he grunted.\n\nEventually, the sprites disappeared into the woods, but by the time the group gathered their senses, it was sunlight.

 fragments.302.d:0 "Atop a hill looming above the small abandoned village, is an unfinished tomb.\n\nReality is broken on this hill. The air hums with dark energy. Monsters of the night seem to appear out of nowhere, some unknown to both the people of Aelantir and Cannor. It is shaped by a black stone, and was not shaped by hand. The tomb is as large as a town hall but much of it is incomplete, and the black stone that seems to have been enveloping the building has left honeycomb-like holes. Peering into them returns only darkness.\nIt is too dark to see any detail in the tomb, but whatever riches in here seem to be long gone. One of the lads does find a stone tablet written in precursor script. Some of it is damaged, but it reads:\n\n"I have come to search for my mother, but have found only the tomb of the destroyer… received stone message… her garden west… destroyer dead… but mind warriors lurk in the woods."\n\nAs the scholar finishes reading, a ghostly chill runs down his spine, and he begs for the group to leave. Many have left already, seeming to prefer the company of the gloomy forest than the tomb."

The company eventually meet with a peculiar tribe, who told us of a tale about a prince from the east.\n\n"The prince was a man born of impure union. Born of brother and niece. Of destroyer and creator. To protect her shameful act, the mother gave up the prince and conjured a sickly child doomed to die in his place – in hopes to trick the world, and she did. The darkness soon came and the destroyer died, but with him so did the world – but the prince was safe.\nThe prince grew to be strong, but sought to find his lost mother, and in his grief dedicated his life to see her again. His search led him to this very forest. He never found his mother, for he could not see between two worlds as the elders warned, but instead settled down and found a home."\n\nFurther research alludes that this is the very same prince, yes, and that the destroyer is no other than Ducaniel himself. Could the Elfenbride, his niece, be the cause of the war that brought upon The Ruin of Aelantir?\n\nNo matter. The Elfenbride’s last location is close. It is in the forests of Old Rzentur, and we have something the prince did not wield - magic."

Laughter and thick, humid forest air dominate your senses. Birds chirp and motes and pixies float as if stars.\nIn the distance, a donkey-headed man lounges surrounded by nymphs. And behind them, soldiers.\n\nA well-built figure, armoured in what looks like hardened leaves leads the column. The green knight utters a single word and many of your companions fall into a trance. Some collapse. The knight’s contingent begins to grab and abduct your men.\nHe goes for you, and in the tussle, you manage to yank his helm off – revealing an ethereal, elf-like visage. You run deep into the forest. It is ancient, and nothing like the one you saw before. You hide in the dirt and sink yourself into a small lake to the point of almost drowning.\n\nAs the night passes, the sounds of joy and laughter from the court become almost deafening. You swear you could hear the voice of one of your compatriots amongst the noise. But, eventually, you manage to sleep.\n\nThe next time you open your eyes you are alone. But it feels cold now. You are back in the forests of Old Rzentur. You are still clutching the green knight’s helmet as if you were a child holding a comforter. You return back to civilization, with stories to tell, and a piece of another world.\n\nYou would return to Old Rzentur one day, many years from now, hoping to find that same tree, but you never do.

Trees and plants that exist in places like Insyaa or Taychend seem to find a home here: a perfectly preserved habitat.\n\nAll parts of the vast estate lead to a grand palace, with recognizable precursor stylizations of the Empire. This does not seem like a place to loot, but a place to preserve. The Elfenbride was no longer here, but she has left us with the best and brightest buildings, plants and animals of her people – the rest of Aelantir seems like a shadow in comparison to an Aelantir-that-was."

But the section after that is what interests us: an image of elves gathered round in a chamber, clasping hands around a central source of power.

What we do know is that the Ruined Sea was once a gigantic landmass, a desert, in fact.

 fragments.6.d:0 "As our explorers in Aelentir continue their journey through the ancient ruins, they have come across what appears to be an ancient logbook, seemingly meant to have kept track of various logistics across the empire of the Precursors. Though our translations are shoddy at best, one name seems to pop up in the logbook again and again; a word which roughly translates to ‘The Pillar of the Heavens’. What this pillar is, and what it represents, we have no way of knowing, but it’s prevalence in this text seems to imply at least some importance to the Precursors. And of course, what the precursors see as important, must surely also be valuable!\n\nSome, however, have doubts, and more than a few members of our expedition are reluctant to go searching for a place that may not even exist, and even if it did exist, may not hold anything of value whatsoever."

The Ruinborn of $PROVINCENAME$, when our translator mentioned the Pillar whilst passing through their village, seemed to instantly warm up to us, greeting us as friends. It turns out, amongst local tales, the Pillar is meant to be their gateway to the afterlife, where the souls of the departed ascend to the heavens. They describe the tower as an endless pillar, ascending higher than the clouds, higher than the heavens themselves, higher even than the realms of the gods, to reach a series of paradises spread across the sky.\n\nIn addition, from what we gather based on many loose interpretations of the Ruinborn’s religious texts, the Pillar seems to have been some sort of tower that served as a main logistical hub for the ancient elves, with mythologised versions of goods such as gemstones, food, damestear, magical scrolls, and various other items all seeming to pass through the tower at some point or another."

Though we were pointed in the right direction, clearly the directions were off somewhat, as even upon arriving at the described location, we were forced to  search around a much larger area. It seems that the directions weren’t entirely accurate.\n\n Eventually, however, after months of searching, we arrived at our goal. The Pillar. Or at least what was left of it. Rather than finding a great tower piercing into the skies above, all that we found was a hollow circle of marble, which appeared to be almost completely covered by the local plant life, surrounded by smaller chunks of marble amongst the undergrowth, leading away from the circle in what is almost a straight line. Although confirming once and for all that the tower indeed existed, it is clear to our expedition that during the Ruin, the Pillar must have been torn from its base, and flung across the continent, leaving only a small circle of stone remaining, as well as the rubble surrounding it. The question now remains; how shall we go about searching for the rest of the tower? Assuming that the rest of the Pillar remains, that is."

Though our journey appeared to be going well, it became clear a few months in that due to some less than accurate mapping on our cartographer’s part, the direction we were headed in was off by a somewhat significant distance. Though we immediately corrected course, the mistake certainly delayed our arrival. \n\nAs we reached ever closer to our quest’s end, however, the very landscape around us seemed to become… stranger. Our expedition began noticing plants that we had never seen before, some with roots that every so often burst out of the soil, as if rejecting it, some with leaves containing images of what appeared to be screaming faces, and a tree that seemed to be able to move so long as no one was looking. As we continued, a sense of unease began to permeate throughout the expedition, until eventually, not only were our fears confirmed, our nightmares were made real. \nFrom seemingly out of nowhere, our expedition was ambushed by a pack of nightmarish beasts, with an almost otherworldly appearance. They appeared to be griffon-like in nature, with their furred bodies and four legs, but where there should have been wings, there were instead two massive, flailing, octopus-like tentacles. Where there should have been a tail, there was instead a stinger, like that of a bee, and where there should have been a face, there was only a single, gaping, roaring, maw.\nThe fighting was bloody, and many in our expedition were lost, but eventually, all of the twisted beasts were slain.
