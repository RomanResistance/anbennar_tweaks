 flavor_orda_aldresia.1.t:0 "The Order of St. Aldresia"
 flavor_orda_aldresia.1.d:0 "The Orda Aldresia (meaning Aldresian Order) was founded after the Aldresian Crusade, when the knight Aldresia led valiant warriors against the undead hordes of the White Pestilience, driving the crusade into the heart of Corvuria and defeating the lich and former acolyte of the Sorcerer King, Cancrec the Defiler. Since then the Orda Aldresia has safeguarded Cannor from undead and other evil threats using the highly secretive art of Diranbe, bladedancing: the ability to cast spells with a blade as if it were a wand.\nThe Order was also instrumental in helping found the Empire of Anbennar in 1221, and eventually turned into the personal bodyguards of the emperor, who they saw as the embodiment of justice and fairness in Cannor.\n\nObviously that has not always been the case, and the order stagnated from chivalrous knights saving all of Cannor to token bodyguards for decadent emperors... until now.\n\nThe High Rectorate has made Aldresia the first ever non-deity saint in the Ravelian Church, and the order has shifted its focus as vanguards of the Ravelian faith."

 flavor_anbenncost.1.t:0 "Half-orcs of Anbenncóst"
 flavor_anbenncost.1.d:0 "The Greentide brought with it a new race, half-orcs: a mixture of human and orcs.\nWhile the first generation of half-orcs, including such legends like Lothane Bluetusk, Grandmaster of the Corintar, were often born of despicable rape from either orcish invaders on human villagers or wicked adventurers on captured orcs, in recent history a good number of half-orcs have been born of mutual couplings in the cities of Escann.\nDespite this, those of orcish blood have often been treated poorly adventurer kingdoms of Escann, and since then many have been making their way to Anbenncóst - a city renowned for its diversity and promise for a new start.\n\nLike many migrants to the city, the majority of half-orcs have settled in in The Bilge, the massive slum that encompasses much of central Anbenncóst."
 flavor_anbenncost.1.a:0 "They've already made a name for themselves as mercenaries"
 flavor_anbenncost.1.b:0 "I assume they'll be nothing more than thugs in The Bilge!"
 flavor_anbenncost.2.t:0 "Orcs of Anbenncóst"
 flavor_anbenncost.2.d:0 "Anbenncósters pride themselves on being uniquely special in their diversity and thus see themselves as the true encapsulation of Anbennar's original values of peace and equality. However, a city is still a city, and where money is to be made, greed will fester.\n\nThe rising slave trade of the orcs in Escann has finally reached the shores of the Damesear, and many passing merchants and haughty lords parade the crowded streets of the city with green folk in chains. Orcish labourers begin to dot the warehouses of mighty trading companies with links to Escann, and even still, orcish manservants and guards start to appear at the most opulent estates in the city. Still, there is hope, and a great number of free orcs have also taken residence in the city during this time, hoping to put behind their dark legacy as invaders of Escann."
 flavor_anbenncost.2.a:0 "Hope will prevail"
 flavor_anbenncost.2.b:0 "I suppose the city is the centre of all things, even this despicable trade"
 flavor_anbenncost.3.t:0 "City Goblins of Anbenncóst"
 flavor_anbenncost.3.d:0 "A great tide of goblins brandishing fancy hats and well-made coats have arrived at the city. These goblins are not the invaders that came with the orcs, but instead goblins that speak our tongue and follow our gods. These goblins are from the city of Bayvic in the Alenic Reach, which had welcomed the goblins as refugees years ago, eventually leading to their rule in their city after dominating the elections.\nMany of these first city goblins are businessmen and magnates, seeking to enrich their home city and their own personal coffers in the city of the world's desire."
 flavor_anbenncost.3.a:0 "City goblins, you say?"
 flavor_anbenncost.3.b:0 "Subsidize their businesses"

 flavor_anbenncost.4.d:0 "Swarms of little scaled men have started appearing huddled in the tight corners of city and at the fronts of small shops and tinker workshops. These are kobolds hailing from the Dragon Coast, and while initially perceived as a monstrous race for much of history, their dimunutive nature and more docile nature compared to loud-mouthed goblins have led them to be tolerated by others in the city with ease. Some talented kobolds have even shown their craft in artificery, and even one or two have been sponsored by the nobility to create some toys!"

 flavor_anbenncost.5.d:0 "In a part where The Bilge (the city's largest sprawl of slums) and the Dovemarket (a large bazaar that stretches across the city's main road) has risen a large enclave full of Halessi and Harimari migrants. They bring strange and foreign wares from the east, and enclave has already become a popular place for all in the city to have a taste of a world beyond Cannor."
 flavor_anbenncost.5.a:0 "I hear they put bubbles in Damerian tea!"
 flavor_anbenncost.6.t:0 "Ruinborn in Big Anbenncóst"
 flavor_anbenncost.6.d:0 "With the colonial endeavours of Aelantir well underway many Ruinborn have made Anbenncóst their home. At first they were often manservants and attache's to diplomats and explorers hailing from the Sea of Ruin, but now many ruinborn from all across the continent have appeared from Kheionai potters to Ynnic smiths forging and selling antiques."

 flavor_anbenncost.6.b:0 "Its been a culture shock for them, to say the last"
